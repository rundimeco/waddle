<P><B>Commission decides to reject wine-production scheme in France </B></H3>
<P><I><B>The Commission has decided not to approve an aid scheme notified and implemented by France in the field of wine production, at the end of a scrutiny procedure started in October 1999. The scheme is aimed at encouraging cognac producers to convert to producing "vin de pays" and plant different kinds of vine in consequence. The scheme is an attempt to deal with the crisis in the cognac industry, which has led to a considerable build-up of stocks. </B></I>
<P>The Commission's finding is that increasing the output of "local wine" (<I>vin de pays</I>) in France would be inconsistent with the principles behind the new common organisation of the market in the wine sector, one of whose goals is to prevent an expansion of Community wine production, and would also be likely to create distortions of competition in a market which, according to currently available figures, is showing no signs of growth. Wine produced after the conversion of these vineyards would enter the normal market in wine, whereas present cognac production by definition goes to a different market. Consequently, the generalised conversion of these vineyards would very likely simply shift the cognac problem into other markets. The Commission also feels that the conversion scheme should have been accompanied by a substantial reduction in production area and yields. 
<P>The Commission believes that only measures adopted within the rules of the common agricultural policy, and more precisely the common market organisation in wine, are likely to ensure that the overall interests of operators in this market throughout the Community are taken into account.
