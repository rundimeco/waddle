The 6.0 million Euro grant project will underpin and increase the sustainability of these project initiatives by significantly improving the administrative capacity and efficiency of the respective counterpart authorities.
<P>The project is part of the Government's Civil Service Modernization Strategy aiming at providing solid and durable management, better use of human resources, up to date information systems and a financial base for sustainable development and improved public services. This strategy shall be implemented through an integrated restructuring package encompassing management reforms, improved deployment of human resources, training and computerization.
<P>The grant of 6.0 million Euro is provided under the cooperation framework laid down in the EC-Yemen Cooperation Agreement of 25 November 1997.
