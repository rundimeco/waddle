<P><B>Commission approves takeover of K</B><B>ömmerling</B><B>'s plastics business by RAG subsidiary HT Troplast </B></H3>
<P><I><B>The Commission has assented to the acquisition of the plastics business of K</B></I><I><B>ömmerling GmbH & Co KG by HT Troplast AG. Both are German companies. K</B></I><I><B>ömmerling is active in plastics extrusion, adhesives and sealants, and window manufacture. HT Troplast, which belongs to the RAG group, is a plastics processor. Insolvency proceedings against the K</B></I><I><B>ömmerling group began in December, and HT Troplast is to buy K</B></I><I><B>ömmerling</B></I><I><B>'s plastic sections, plate and sheet manufacture and distribution business from the receiver. </B></I>
<P>HT Troplast's and Kömmerling's businesses overlap only in one product area, namely PVC windowframe materials. The examination of the market carried out by the Commission has shown that it is characterised by cross-border trade, overcapacity and intense price competition. PVC, wood and aluminium compete with one another as substitute windowframe materials, so that the competitive pressure on the markets in windowframes is strong.
<P>On none of the possible markets investigated will the merger create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded in the common market or in a substantial part of it.
