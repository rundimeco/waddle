<P><B>Access to Environmental Information: Commission moves against Austria</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has decided to send a Reasoned Opinion (second warning letter) to Austria for failure to implement correctly the Access to Environmental Information Directive. Austria has adopted a number of pieces of legislation at the Federal and Regional level to implement this Directive. However, several shortcomings were identified by the Commission in all the Federal and Regional legal acts sent to the Commission by Austria.  Therefore, the Commission addressed a letter of formal notice (first warning letter) to Austria last year. Much of the legislation has subsequently been corrected and completed as regards the Federal law and the laws of three Regions. However, a number of Regions, in particular Burgenland and Salzburg have still not provided the Commission with appropriate implementing legislation and shortcomings have been identified with regard to legislative drafts provided by the Regions of Lower Austria and Carinthia (and to a minor extent with regard to existing legislation of Styria and the Tyrol). </B></I>
<P>Commenting on the decision, Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstr√∂m said:  "The Directive on public access to environmental information provides an essential democratic tool for European citizens. I urge the Austrian authorities to finalize their legislation for the whole country as quickly as possible"
<P>The Access to Environmental Information Directive  (Council Directive 90/313/EEC on the freedom of access to information on the environment) requires Member States to ensure that the public has access to environmental information without having to prove an interest.
