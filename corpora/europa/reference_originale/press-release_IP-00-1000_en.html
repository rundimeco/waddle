<P><B>Commission approves acquisition of sole control in Italian tour operator Alpitur by Ifil</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has approved the acquisition of sole control in Italian tour operator Alpitour by Ifil, which belongs to Italian group G. Agnelli & C. Sapaz.  The operation does not modify the competitive structure of the Italian market for tour operators as Ifil</B></I><I><B>'s only presence in the sector is through Alpitour, which has a</B></I><I><B>Â  market share of around 16 percent. </B></I>
<P>Ifil - Finanziaria di Partecipazioni S.p.A. is an Italian holding which has financial participations in companies active in various economic areas, such as automobile, banking, internet services, retail and tourism. 
<P>Alpitour S.p.A.<B> </B>is also an Italian company active in the tourism sector, especially as a tour operator.
<P>Before the operation, Alpitour was controlled by Ifil and Blufint, with a small shareholder Park Lane holding also 13%.  According to the deal notified to the Commission, Ifil buys Park Lane's minority shareholding, therefore acquiring a controlling majority in Alptitour's shareholders' assembly and board of administrators.
<P>The Commission concluded that the operation did not present competition problems, as Ifil's share of the Italian tour operating market is only the one already held by Alpitour (around 16%).  Ifil has some minority and financial participations in other companies active in the tourism sector, which do not, however, confer control rights.
