<P><B>Commission gives go-ahead to planned joint venture between Chemag, Beiselen and BayWa</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has approved the planned joint venture in the area of trade in fertilisers between German companies mg chemag ag, a subsidiary of Metallgesellschaft, BayWa, controlled by Bayerische Raiffeisen Beteiligungs GmbH, and Beiselen, belonging to Schuler GmbH & Co. Verm</B></I><I><B>Ã¶gensverwaltungen group. The joint venture will be active in the import of fertilisers from Eastern Europe into Germany and supplies to wholesalers. The Commission</B></I><I><B>'s investigation showed that the operation will not create or strengthen a dominant position on the market.</B></I>
<P>Mg chemag's activities include trade in and distribution of chemical products, agricultural inputs, minerals and energy feedstocks. BayWa and Beiselen are active in the wholesale trade in fertilisers. Mg chemag has transferred its branch of activity "cross-border trade in fertilisers (import and export)" to the joint venture, Chemag Agrarchemikalien GmbH. The joint venture will carry on the business activities of this branch, which focuses on the import of fertilisers from Eastern European countries into Germany and supplies to wholesalers. The examination carried out by the Commission revealed that the joint venture did not threaten to restrict competition within the meaning of the Merger Regulation in any of the relevant markets.
<P>Mg chemag has only a small market share in sales of fertilisers to wholesalers. BayWa is indirectly involved through another company in sales of fertilisers to wholesalers. However, there is no significant addition of market shares. Accordingly, there is no question of the operation creating or strengthening a dominant position. The examination also showed that there was no risk of coordination of the competitive behaviour of BayWa and Beiselen in the fertiliser wholesale trade.
