<P><B>Commission proposes European Strategy for Integrated Coastal Zone Management</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has adopted two texts related to Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM). The first sets out a European Strategy to address the deterioration of conditions in coastal zones. The strategy underlines the need for informed, coordinated and complementary action by all levels of administration, and the involvement of all of the stakeholders who use or manage a coastal zone. As a component of this strategy, the Commission also adopted a proposal for a Recommendation encouraging the Member States to develop their own national strategies for ICZM. The Commission's action in this field comes as a response to the increased pressure on coastal zones from activities such as tourism, industry, fishing etc.</B></I>
<P>On adoption Environment Commissioner Margot Wallström said: « all stakeholders need to join force to preserve and improve the environment in coastal zones. With this initiative, the Commission is providing guidance and concrete tools for more sustainable management of our coasts. »
<P>More and more people are using the coastal zones of Europe - for recreation, for commerce, for industry, for fisheries and aquaculture, as residence. As a result, in many parts of Europe, coastal resources are being degraded by high levels of unplanned and uncoordinated use. The physical and biological environment is being destroyed and the social fabric of the coastal populations is unravelling.
<P>Because of its concern about these serious problems, the Commission has adopted a Communication, proposed by Environment Commissioner Margot Wallström in agreement with Michel Barnier Regional Policy and Institutional Reform Commissioner, announcing a European Strategy for Integrated Coastal Zone Management. The Communication is the conclusion of a three-year demonstration programme involving 35 pilot projects and a broad consultation with the interested parties in the final stage.  
<P>In the spirit of promoting good governance, the strategy aims to address the underlying problems facing the coastal zone - namely: lack of information, insufficient participation by stakeholders and uncoordinated planning and management by different sectors and levels of administration. The Communication particularly highlights the need for everyone to work together to ensure the future vitality of our coasts. National governments, local and regional administrations, NGOs, local residents, visitors, tourist operators, fishermen, port operators all have a role to play to ensure that the coastal zone is well managed.  
<P>The Commission commits itself to doing its part by providing leadership and guidance at the EU level. The 38 specific actions outlined in the Communication include commitments by the Commission to:
<UL><P><LI>work to ensure that EU policies are compatible with good, coordinated planning and management of coastal zones,
<P><LI>launch a network for coastal zone planners and managers, 
<P><LI>promote an increase in the knowledge about coastal zones - through its research and information activities,
<P><LI>provide finance for certain innovative activities in coastal zone management, and  
<P><LI>promote action at other administrative levels.
</UL><P>As a part of this strategy, the Commission has adopted a proposal for a European Parliament and Council Recommendation to the Member States concerning Integrated Coastal Zone Management. This Recommendation would call upon the Member States to develop their own national strategies for ICZM, starting from a full assessment of how the coastal zones within each country are used and managed. The national strategies should include measures to coordinate the relevant legislation and regulations, ensure adequate monitoring and information diffusion, and address questions related to capacity building.

<P><B>Background</B>
<UL><P><B>The Problems of the Coastal Zone</B>
</UL><P>Some of the problems facing coastal zones include:
<UL><P><LI>Beaches are disappearing and waves are washing up against buildings that were constructed too close to the shoreline; Sand dunes - which once provided a natural Natural protection against the waves - have been destroyed. Often engineering works have contributed to accelerated erosion of the adjacent shoreline because the works were undertaken without an adequate understanding of coastal dynamics and processes. Extraction of gas is another factor that can increase coastal erosion.
<P><LI>Natural habitats are being destroyed and biodiversity is declining -- This means not only less seabirds to watch, but also less coastal and offshore fish stocks as spawning grounds are destroyed; Regional Biodiversity Action Plans have identified up to 30 actions necessary to prevent further habitat loss and arrest species decline in certain coastal areas in the North-West European Metropolitan area. 
<P><LI>Soil and water resources are becoming contaminated, as pollution from marine or on-land sources, including landfills, migrates to the coastline; in some Member States, river borne pollution derived from agricultural runoff upstream in neighbouring countries is affecting the quality of coastal waters.
<P><LI>In some place, there are water shortages as demand exceeds supply. Overpumping of coastal aquifers is a major problem in many parts of the Mediterranean basin. The damage to the aquifer normally results in a permanent reduction in the quality and quantity of water resources available for the future.
<P><LI>As resources are degraded, opportunities for durable employment are lost. For example, Boats for pleasure fishing are frequently treated with tributyltin (TBT), which can have a negative impact on the aquaculture industry. And, as spawning areas are destroyed, and fishing stocks decline, the disappearance of traditional sectors, such as small scale coastal fisheries, leads to unemployment and social instability.
<P><LI>Furthermore, uncontrolled development (especially of tourism) leads to a destruction of cultural heritage and dilution of the social fabric. And, land speculation and lack of year round facilities can also drive out local residents. The inadequate road network and lack of overall development of the local economy except for tourist purposes in many peripheral or isolated coastal areas has led to out-migration, which in turn results in low levels of facilities that help to attract and maintain a vibrant local community.
</UL><P><B>The European Commission's Demonstration Programme on Integrated Coastal Zone Management</B>
<P>October 1995:  A Demonstration Programme on the integrated management of the coastal zones is announced by the Commission (in COM95/511).
<P>1996 - early 1997 : 35 pilot project are selected and launching with co-financing from the LIFE, TERRA and PHARE programmes (as well as one project entirely financed by the Norwegian government)
<P>1997 - 1999:   Regular meetings of the project leaders, and of the national experts group, to evaluate the progress of the Demonstration Programme.
<P>January, 1998: The interim report on the Demonstration Programme is published (COM97/744).
<P>1998 : Six experts evaluate the experiences of the demonstration projects in a series of thematic studies concerning Legislation, Participation, Technology, Sectorial and Territorial Cooperation, EU Policies, and Information.
<P>May, 1999: The Commission produces two technical documents summarising the lessons of Demonstration Programme. ("Towards a European Strategy for Integrated Coastal Zone Management: General Principles and Policy Options" and "Lessons from the European Commission's Demonstration Programme on Integrated Coastal Zone Management")
<P>May - October, 1999 : The Commission conducts a broad public consultation concerning the appropriate future role of the EU in promoting better planning and management of the coastal zones
<P>8 September 2000:  The Commission adopts its final conclusions on the Demonstration Programme and announces a European Strategy for Integrated Coastal Zone Management (COM2000/547) and proposes a European Parliament and Council Recommendation to the Member States concerning the implementation of Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Europe (COM2000/545).
