<P><B>Wild Birds and Habitats: the Commission challenges defects in Belgian, Swedish, Portuguese and Luxembourg legislation</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has decided further steps in legal actions against Belgium, Sweden, Portugal and Luxembourg for defects in the national legislation to give effect to the European Union's Wild Birds Directive and Habitats Directive. Under the Wild Birds Directive, the Commission has decided to refer Sweden to the European Court of Justice and to send two Reasoned Opinions (second warning letters) to Belgium. In the case of the Habitats Directive, the Commission has decided to refer Belgium and Luxembourg to the Court of Justice and to send a Reasoned Opinion to Sweden.  The Commission has also decided to send a Reasoned Opinion to Portugal addressing defects in the Portuguese legislation dealing with both Directives.  </B></I>
<P>Commenting on the decisions, Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstr√∂m said:  "Correct national legislation is vital for the implementation of these two key nature conservation Directives.  I urge the Member States concerned to make every effort to bring their national laws into line with what the Directives require ".
<P>The Wild Birds Directive (Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds) is the Community's oldest piece of nature conservation legislation and creates a comprehensive scheme of protection for the Community's wild bird species. There are a number of separate but related components making up the scheme of protection under the Wild Birds Directive. One is habitat conservation, in particular through Special Protection Areas (SPAs). A second consists of a set of prohibitions on direct threats to birds (such as deliberate destruction of nests and eggs) as well as associated activities such as trade in live or dead birds. A third comprises rules on hunting, which limit the species which can be hunted, the periods during which they can be hunted and the methods of hunting them. For the second and third components, it is possible to have derogations, but derogations must meet strict requirements<sup><a name="file.tmp_Ref_1"><a href="#file.tmp_Foot_1">(1)</a></a></sup>. 
<P>The Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild flora and fauna) creates a similar scheme of protection, this time extended to a range of animals and plants as well as a range of habitat types. It envisages the creation of a network of protected sites known as Natura 2000, which will embrace SPAs under the Wild Birds Directive. The Habitats Directive also amends certain of the habitat conservation provisions of the Wild Birds Directive.
<P>As regards the Wild Birds Directive, the decision to make an application to the Court of Justice against <B>Sweden</B> concerns outstanding weaknesses in the Swedish legislation, notwithstanding progress made in 1999. In particular, Swedish habitat conservation safeguards are inadequate: the Swedish legislation does not ensure the assessment of all plans and projects likely to significantly affect SPAs. 
<P>Sweden has sent proposed legislation to deal with the defects, but this legislation is only intended to apply from 2001, which is unsatisfactory.  
<P>One of the Reasoned Opinions decided against <B>Belgium</B> concerns to the failure to implement the full set of prohibitions under the Directive in Wallonia. The other Reasoned Opinion against Belgium relates to the failure of Belgian legislation to ensure that, where Special Protection Areas (SPAS) are designated under the Directive,  the necessary protection  regime will apply.
<P>As regards the Habitats Directive, the decisions to make applications to the Court of Justice against <B>Belgium</B> and <B>Luxembourg</B> and to notify a Reasoned Opinion to <B>Sweden</B> relate to extensive shortcomings in the national legislation sent by these Member States to the Commission. Amongst other matters, these concern habitat conservation safeguards as well as prohibitions and derogations. In the case of Sweden, the defects mirror those which are covered in the Reasoned Opinion concerning the Wild Birds Directive, i.e. in particular, plans and projects likely to significantly affect Natura 2000 sites established under the Directive are not adequately addressed in the legislation. 
<P>As regards the decision to notify a Reasoned Opinion to <B>Portugal</B>, this relates to serious weaknesses in the transposition of both Directives, in particular in relation to habitat conservation safeguards.  As in the case of Sweden, the Portuguese legislation does not ensure that all plans and projects likely to significantly affect Natura 2000 sites are adequately addressed.
<P>The Commission's decision reflects its commitment to ensuring that the conditions for securing the protection of Europe's wildlife and habitats are fully in place across the Community.<p><sup><a name="file.tmp_Foot_1"><a href="#file.tmp_Ref_1">(1)</a></a></sup><SUP><B> Article 9</B></SUP>
