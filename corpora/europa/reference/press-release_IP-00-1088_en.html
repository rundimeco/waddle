<P><B>Commission allows Carrefour to take sole control of the Belgian supermarket chain GB</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The Commission has given the go-ahead for the Carrefour group to acquire sole control of GB, the Belgian supermarket operator. Carrefour already held a minority stake in GB following its takeover of Promod</B></I><I><B>ès. The Commission's investigation led it to conclude that the operation is not likely to create or strengthen a dominant position on the relevant markets.</B></I>
<P>The Carrefour group is mainly engaged in the retailing of convenience goods in large or medium-sized outlets. Although it does not itself own any stores in Belgium, since its merger with Promodès, which the Commission authorised on 25 January this year, the Carrefour group has held a minority stake in the GB group and the Belgian firm Mestdagh. 
<P>The GB group operates a chain of supermarkets, hypermarkets and convenience stores in Belgium.
<P>The Commission found that, in general, the Belgian food retail market is quite heavily concentrated, with the three leading distributors having a combined market share of around 60% and GB itself a 30% share. But, since there will be no addition of market shares, the notified operation will not affect the existing competitive situation.
<P>On the upstream market, the Commission's investigation confirmed that the operation will in no way affect the suppliers of GB and Mestdagh as those two companies already obtain their supplies from local and national producers through the same Belgian national buying syndicate. They also already benefit from terms negotiated by the Carrefour group for their international purchases and some of their national purchases.
<P>The Commission consequently found the operation to be compatible with the common market and authorised it.
