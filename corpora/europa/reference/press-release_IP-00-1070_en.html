<P><B>Statement of the President of the European Commission on the elections in Yugoslavia</B></H3>
<P>I congratulate Mr Kostunica and the democratic opposition in Serbia on their victory. Everybody recognizes that, except Mr Milosevic. They have won, despite all the efforts that were made, and are still being made, to ignore the will of the people.
<P>The people of Serbia have voted massively for change - for democracy, for a peaceful transition, and above all, to rejoin the European family.
<P>The European Union has made it very clear: democratic change in Serbia will lead to a radical change in our policy.  
<P>We have said that we stand ready to reach out and welcome a democratic Serbia with open arms.
<P>The people of Serbia have made clear that they want a fresh start. They want new leaders and the chance to leave the past behind.
<P>I call upon Mr Milosevic and those around him to respect the clear will of the Serbian people. 
<P>I say to the democratic opposition: Europe is ready to help you rebuild a democratic Serbia. 
<P>The European Commission is already working on help for Serbia to rebuild its economy and infrastructure, as soon as the will of the people is respected. We will be ready to lift sanctions; and to provide emergency aid to cope with hardship over the winter. 
<P>It is a huge job. We want to get to work immediately - the moment the will of people has prevailed.
