<P><B>Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession (ISPA) : first visit of Commissioner Barnier in Poland</B></H3>
<P><I><B>Michel Barnier, European Commissioner for regional policy and institutional reform, makes today his first visit to a candidate country. He will meet in Warsaw Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, Minister of regional development and construction Jerzy Kropiwnicki, and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wladyslaw Bartoszewski. He is signing in Lodz with Secretary of the Committee for European Integration, Minister Jacek Saryusz</B></I><I><B>Wolski, the Financing Memoranda for three major transport and environment projects. He will then visit the European Institute and meet Voivodships Marchals.</B></I>
<P>With Prime Minister Buzek and Foreign Affairs Minister Bartoszewski, Michel Barnier will discuss the current reform of the European institutions underway in the intergovernemental conference. His visit will also be focused on the preparation of Poland for the structural policies and the economic and social cohesion policy of the European Union. 
<P>Michel Barnier, Commissioner responsible for regional policy, stated at this occasion: "My  first visit to Poland and the signature of three major decisions under the new ISPA instrument show the enormous efforts Poland pays for the preparation for the accession to the Union. These projects are the outcome of an excellent partnership with the Polish authorities. I am firmly convinced that they will help Poland in its preparation for joining the Union, as well as promoting economic and social cohesion in Europe before enlargement". 
<P>Poland will be granted around 345 million euros over a seven year period. ISPA provides financial support for investment in the areas of environment and transport in order to speed up compliance in accession countries with  European legislation in force for these two sectors and a total budget that amounts to 7.4 billion Euro for the 10 applicant countries. In Poland, the European Union will contribute to the construction of the A4 Motorway Section KleszczówSosnica, to the modernisation of the E-20 Railway Line Section Minsk MazowieckiSiedlce and to the construction of Bydgoszcz water supply and sewerage network. The total contribution for the three projects will represent  210.94 million Euro. The financing memoranda on which agreement has been reached set out the following provisions :
<UL><P><LI>Construction of the A4 Motorway Section KleszczówSosnicaTotal ISPA contribution: 84.2 million Euro of which 67 million Euro committed in 2000.
<P><LI>Modernisation of the E-20 Railway Line Section Minsk MazowieckiSiedlce Total ISPA contribution: 93.4 million Euro of which 67.8 millionEuro committed in 2000.
<P><LI>Bydgoszcz water supply and sewerage networkTotal ISPA contribution: 32.8 million Euro of which 26.2 million Euro committed in 2000.
</UL><P>For transport, the priority is given to investments which contribute to the better integration of the Polish transport system with that of the EU and the future Trans European Network (TEN). Priority is also given to improve transport links with the other Accession countries, as well as to improve the national transport system by eliminating missing links. Support will also be given to projects providing continuity with those undertaken in previous years. 
<P>The main priority for the environment is to assist Poland to comply with European environmental legislation. Priorities are in particular given to drinking water, waste water treatment and solid waste disposal. Emphasis has so far been put on the main cities where  the greatest environmental impact is expected and where a larger proportion of the population would benefit straight away. Most of the projects contribute to the cleaning of the Odra and the Wisla rivers which are tributaries of the Baltic Sea. The Baltic Sea has been classified as a sensitive environment area.
<P>The majority of the projects in the environment sector concern the improvement of waste water treatment (Bydgoszcz, Constanta, Györ etc.) but there are also projects in the waste management sector (Peatri Neamt, Hajdu Bihar).  In the transport sector, a balance has been struck between road rehabilitation projects (Poland, Romania, Bulgaria etc.) and rail improvements (Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia). Moreover, one airport reconstruction project has received a favourable opinion (Sofia).
<P>The signature concerns three projects that received an agreement of principle from the ISPA management Committee in June and July. With the signature of the projects, the financing of the projects will start.

<P><B>Annex </B><B>Background - ISPA</B>
<P>ISPA (Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession) is intended to prepare applicant countries to respect Community standards for infrastructure in  transport and in the field of environment. In allocating financial support to the beneficiary countries, the Commission intends to strike an even balance between transport and environmental measures. Its main priorities in preparing the applicant countries for accession are : 
<UL><P><LI>Familiarising them with the policies and procedures of the Union 
<P><LI>Helping them catch up with EU environmental standards 
<P><LI>Expanding and linking with the trans-European transport networks (TENs) 
</UL><P><B>Sectors receiving assistance</B>
<UL><P><B>1. The environment </B>
</UL><P>The applicant countries generally face great environmental problems, particularly with regard to water pollution, waste management and air pollution. Major efforts will therefore be needed, involving considerable amounts of technical and financial aid from the Union, if these countries are to catch up quickly with the 'acquis communautaire' on the environment.  To deal with the worst environmental problems, assistance from ISPA will be concentrated mainly on : drinking-water supply,  treatment of waste water, solid-waste management and air pollution. 
<UL><P><B>2. Transport</B>
</UL><P>Improving transport infrastructures is a crucial part of the applicant countries' economic development strategies. Developing efficient transport systems is thus an essential component in the pre-accession strategy.  ISPA assistance goes to transport infrastructure projects which encourage sustainable forms of moving people and goods, in particular projects which are of Community interest, identified at the Helsinki and Crete conferences, and also projects which enable the countries concerned to meet the objectives of the Accession Partnerships. This will include expanding the TENs to provide good connections between the Union and the applicant countries and interconnections between national networks and links from them to the TENs.  
<P>A small part of ISPA's budget will also be used to fund preparatory studies and technical assistance. 
<P><B>Financial provisions</B>
<P>The allocation of ISPA resources among the recipient countries is decided by the Commission using criteria based on population, per capita GDP (in purchasing power parity terms) and land surface area.  The rate of assistance can be up to 75% of eligible public expenditure, but in exceptional cases up to 85%. The actual rate will depend on the matching funds available,  potential revenues generated from projects, and application of the 'polluter-pays' principle.
