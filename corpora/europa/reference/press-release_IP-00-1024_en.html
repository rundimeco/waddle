<P><B>Commission brings its review of regional aid in the Community</B><B> </B><B>to a successful conclusion with the approval of the  maps for Italy and Belgium</B></H3>
<P><I><B>Today, the European Commission approved the regional aid maps for Belgium and Italy for the period 2000 to 2006. With these two approvals, the Commission concluded its review of assisted areas in the Community. The exercise was launched in 1998 and set out to tighten up the control of national regional  aid, which is by far the most important category of  State aid in the Community. As a result of this review, Member States agreed to concentrate regional aid on those areas facing the most severe disadvantages and to reduce significantly the levels of aid throughout  the Union. Competition Commissioner Mario Monti expressed his satisfaction with today</B></I><I><B>'s decisions: </B></I><I><B>"I am very glad that this exercise is now concluded. I am aware that the review confronted some national authorities with difficult choices. However, I should stress that throughout this sensitive exercise, co-operation with the national and regional authorities has been excellent and this has enabled the Commission to achieve a better targeting of the regional aid maps. This will improve the effectiveness of regional State aid measures whilst minimising their distortive effect on competition and trade in the Union.</B></I><I><B>" </B></I>
<P>At the end of 1997, the Commission adopted new Guidelines on regional aid in the Community. Between 1996 and 1998, Member States granted â‚¬ 18.8 billion in State aid for regional assistance purposes. This represented 57.6% of all State aid granted to industry and services in the Union. Over the years, the Commission had witnessed a proliferation of regional aid measures throughout the Community, and also a gradual increase in the coverage of areas qualifying for regional aid. 
<P>With the 1997 Guidelines on national regional aid, the Commission wanted to strengthen the control of this important type of State aid. The new Guidelines consolidated the criteria used to assess the compatibility of national regional aid measures. The Guidelines also clarified the rules for the demarcation of regions qualifying for regional aid under Article 87(3)(a) and (c) of the EC Treaty. Article 87(3)(a) regions are defined as regions where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment. Article 87(3)(c) areas are problem areas defined on the basis of (national) indicators and proposed by the Member States.
<P>In the beginning of 1998, the Commission informed Member States of the new Guidelines and invited them to bring their existing regional aid systems in line with the new rules by the year 2000. A key element of the exercise was the review of the regional aid maps in each of the 15 Member States. The difficulty of this exercise was exacerbated by the fact that the Commission wanted to use this opportunity to implement a sizeable reduction in the coverage of the regional aid maps in the Community. 
<P>Today's approval of the maps for Italy and Belgium marks the successful conclusion of this difficult and politically sensitive exercise. The Commission considers that it has attained its main objectives. All maps have been defined on the basis of a transparent and objective method ensuring equality of treatment for all 15 Member States. At the same time, the Commission has succeeded, with the help of the Member States, to reduce significantly the population coverage of the regional aid maps from 47.3% to 43.7% of the Community's population. A strict application of the eligibility criteria has resulted in a tighter demarcation of the assisted regions. This should enable Member States to focus their regional assistance on the regions suffering the most severe economic problems. The Commission is convinced that a greater degree of concentration will  enhance the incentive quality of the regional aid granted, thereby increasing its overall effectiveness.
<P>At the same time,  the Commission has reduced the maximum aid intensities applicable in regional aid areas. The 1997 Guidelines provide that aid intensity ceilings in the least favoured regions (the so-called Article 87(3)(a) regions) should normally not exceed 50% after tax (down from 75% in the past). For the other regional aid areas (so-called Article 87(3)(c) regions), this ceiling is set at 20% after tax (compared to 30% in the past). In many cases, the Commission was able to convince Member States to set the aid intensity ceilings at levels well below these upper limits. As a result, the average aid intensity ceiling during the period 2000 to 2006 will be limited to 39% in Article 87(3)(a) regions and to only 17% in the Article 87(3)(c) areas. 
<P>With today's decisions, the Commission accepted the Article 87(3)(c) maps which the Belgian and Italian authorities had submitted in December 1999 (the Italian Article 87(3)(a) map covering the least favoured regions in South Italy had already been approved by the Commission on 1 March 2000). The approval of the two maps will enable the Belgian and Italian authorities to provide investment aid to large firms and to SMEs located in the eligible areas. 
<P>The Belgian and the Italian Article 87(3)(c) maps follow the general trend of geographical concentration and lower aid ceilings. The coverage of the Article 87(3)(c) areas was reduced from 35.0% to 30.9% in the case of Belgium and from 14.7% to 10.0% in the case of Italy. Also the aid intensity ceilings were reduced significantly in both cases, to an average intensity of 15.6% in the case of Belgium  and to 10.0% in the case of Italy.
