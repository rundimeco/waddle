<P><B>EC Conference on projects in support of Roma communities Brussels, 17 </B><B> 18 September 2000</B></H3>
<P><I><B>In view of its support to the socio-economic and democratic development of the Roma communities in Central and Eastern Europe, the European Commission is organising a conference to identify best practices for future programming, based on past and ongoing initiatives. The conference will take place on Monday 18 September 2000 at the Charlemagne building in Brussels and gather 60 representatives from those projects that have been financed by the European Commission in the framework of various Phare initiatives, most notably the LIEN programme but also Partnership and Democracy. All participants will come from the beneficiary countries and a considerable number of them belong to the local Roma communities. The coordination group of the Phare multi-beneficiary programmes will attend the conference, as well. </B></I>
<P>At the conference the European Commission will present the general framework of its activities regarding the Roma communities, the European Directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, and the newly established Phare Access programme for non-governmental organisations. Key-note speaker is Prof. Liégeois from the Gypsy Research Centre of the Université Paris V. The conference will focus on presentations and discussions of project beneficiaries and address three interconnected socio-economic themes that are of paramount importance to the Roma communities in general, and its youngsters and women in particular: income generation & employment, education & training, and health. In order to give the project representatives ample time to network, exchange know-how and identify best practices, preparatory worskhops on the three main conference topics will be held the day before. 
<P>The proceedings of the conference and the documents that have been discussed during the meeting will be published by the European commission.
