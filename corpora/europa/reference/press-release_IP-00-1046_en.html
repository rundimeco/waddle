<P><I><B>Yesterday Romano Prodi received a delegation from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to mark a worldwide demonstration organised by the UNHCR on 21 September in the wake of the recent loss of four of its staff in West Timor and Guinea. The delegation handed Mr Prodi a copy of the appeal made to all governments and all UN Member States for the ratification and implementation of the 1994 Convention on the security of personnel, and for those governments which had not yet done so to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which regards attacks on personnel involved in a humanitarian assistance mission as a war crime.</B></I>
<P>Mr Prodi assured the delegation that he backed the UNHCR initiative to secure ratification and supported any steps to improve the safety of staff in the places to which their missions took them.
