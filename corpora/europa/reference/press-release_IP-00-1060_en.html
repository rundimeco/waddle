<P><B>Commission starts research for super-economical car</B></H3>
<P><I><B>As Europe recovers from the recent protests over fuel prices, and the realisation of just how dependent we are on petrol and diesel fuel, the European Commission has launched a </B></I><I><B>€5.2 million research project on lightweight materials. Half of this sum comes from the Commission, the other half from the project</B></I><I><B>'s partners. Lightweight materials are the key to low petrol consumption in cars and the aim of the project is to produce the materials </B></I><I><B> by 2004 - for a prototype car travelling 100 km on just one litre of diesel fuel. </B></I><I><B>"This research project is a joint effort by the car industry, research laboratories and materials producers to give at least a partial answer to the question of Europe</B></I><I><B>'s dependence on oil and to reduce output of CO</B></I><I><B>²</B></I><I><B>" said Commissioner Phillipe Busquin.</B></I>
<P>The project was launched in April this year and will end early 2004. By that time an ultra-lightweight version of Volkswagen's Lupo TDI should be ready for production. The car would make use of low-cost carbon composites, which will reduce the vehicle's weight by about 40%, improving fuel economy and reducing CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions drastically. One current problem with new materials is cost since, ultimately, production costs will be the major determining factor for the success or failure of the future product. However, in this new project the intention is to reduce the number of parts used to just 30% of the 200+ parts needed today.  The reduction in the number of parts would make this car concept cost effective, despite the fact that the costs per part are expected to be higher than for conventional manufacturing. By the end of the research project scientists should have developed and tested the technologies and methods necessary for commercial production at a rate of 50 units/day.
<P>This project is part of work on light-weight materials carried out by the EU's research programme for Competitive and Sustainable Growth (part of the Fifth Framework Programme for research and development) under its key action on land transport and marine technologies.
<P>This project is part of an overall strategy of the Commission to make the use of cars, busses and trucks more sustainable and to reduce pollution of the atmosphere (such as the development of fuel cell driven vehicles with zero emission). Another research activity concentrates on the development of smaller engines. Improvements of up to 30% fuel economy can be expected in the future from these new power trains, in particular those based on downsized gasoline and diesel engines and advanced combustion modes.
