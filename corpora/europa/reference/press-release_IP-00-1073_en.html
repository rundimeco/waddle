<P><B>WHO and EU fight jointly for further tobacco controls </B></H3>
<P><I><B>On 16 October the negotiations for the creation of a WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control will start in Geneva. In the run up to the event, Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, Director General of the World Health Organisation and David Byrne, European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection underlined the importance attached by the EU and WHO to this convention during a visit of Dr Brundtland to the European Commission. </B></I>
<P>"Tobacco use is the most significant avoidable source of disease and premature mortality. In the European Union alone, over 500,000 deaths per year are caused by tobacco consumption while globally 4 million die annually from tobacco. Smoking leads to significant death and disease from cancer, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease in adults as well as severe health effects in children exposed to tobacco smoke. The death toll caused by tobacco consumption can and must be avoided".
<P>The spread of smoking is ensured by a combination of advertising and promotion, product design and by the highly addictive nature of tobacco itself. 
<P>The European Union has repeatedly addressed this major public health concern through various initiatives.  The latest proposal for a directive on tobacco products is currently being examined by the European Parliament and Council.  The European Commission has proposed to reduce the tar content of cigarettes and to introduce a ceiling on nicotine and carbon monoxide. The use of misleading terms such as "light", or "low-tar" would be forbidden, and additives used in tobacco products would have to be declared and analysed for the first time in Europe.  Finally, the proposal envisages a major increase in the size of warning labels on tobacco products.
<P>The World Health Organisation has proposed the creation of a WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.  This could address some key issues such as cross-border advertising, sponsorship and promotion of tobacco, often targeted at the developing world and transition economies. The European Community will participate actively in these important negotiations, due to begin in Geneva on 16 October.  The Member States of the European Community have mandated the European Commission to negotiate on its behalf in areas of Community competence.
<P>The WHO and EU are committed to strengthening tobacco control. Governments should not support measures that advertise or glamorise tobacco products. We must do all we can to protect the health of current and future generations."
