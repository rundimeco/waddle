<P><B>Commission proposes to coordinate Civil Protection intervention in the event of emergencies</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has proposed to establish a Community mechanism for Civil Protection intervention in the event of natural, technological and environmental disasters, inside and outside the European Union. Through this mechanism it will be possible to mobilise and provide prompt support with necessary operational resources to assist a country in need of help. The aim is also to ensure better-coordinated and more efficient interventions. The Commission believes that the proposed mechanism will contribute to save lives and protect the environment by limiting damage and pollution.</B></I>
<P>Upon presenting the proposal Environment Commissioner Margot Wallström said: "This proposal is designed to respond to the expectations of European citizens. Experience from recent environmental, natural and technological disasters provoked calls for urgent improvement of EU actions to rescue persons and protect the environment. With this proposal the Commission wants to enable concrete and prompt assistance from intervention teams from EU Member States' when the resources of a country are not sufficient to deal with disasters. With improved coordination of these interventions teams we can better achieve this aim." 
<P>Michel Barnier, Commissioner in charge for regional policy and institutional reforms stated : "The new scheme will improve interventions in case of disasters throughout Europe by a better coordination of means and the strengthening of communication and training capacities. The European system can be mobilised in an emergency at any time."
<P>Earlier this year, when he presented the five-year programme of the Commission to the European Parliament, Commission President Romano Prodi called for action to reinforce European Civil Protection. This followed a series of natural, technological and environmental disasters, which caused severe damage in a number of Member States and neighbouring countries. The European Parliament has also adopted a number of Resolutions inviting the Commission to take such initiatives.
<P>These disasters have included earthquakes, the oil spill off the coast of Brittany, devastating storms in several Member States and disastrous flooding in some of the candidate countries. Dam failures caused serious pollution in the Danube, and the fireworks explosion in the Netherlands resulted in considerable loss of life. The loss in the European Union due to these disasters has been enormous, hundreds of lives lost, and 15.000 persons were killed in the first earthquake in Turkey. Dozens of billions of Euro have been the direct economic costs (about 20 billion only in the wake of the storms in France and hundreds of millions as a consequence of the oil spill). 
<P>Experience from these disasters in recent years has shown that the present system lacks the capacity to mobilise significant and sufficient resources from Member States and to coordinate interventions as required. This has clearly indicated the need for a significantly reinforced mechanism, as called for at the political level.
<P>The Commission proposal for an improved Civil Protection mechanism consists of the following four key elements: 
<UL><P><LI>Pre-identification of intervention resources. Aim: to identify in advance the intervention teams available within the Civil Protection services of the Member States at very short notice (generally within a time frame of 2-24 hours after the emergency occurs) and which could be mobilised (their composition varying according to the type of emergency and the particular needs in that emergency).
<P><LI>Training programme to improve response capability. Aim: to set up a training programme to improve the ability of these teams to work jointly and to promote optimum complementarity between them. This programme will encompass joint training and exercises, and opportunities for team members to be seconded for short periods to teams in other Member States. 
<P><LI>Assessment and coordination teams. Aim: make it possible to mobilise a small assessment and coordination team and dispatch it immediately to the scene. This should improve on-the-scene efficiency and coordination and enable rapid identification of the resources which are most appropriate for dealing with the emergency. The teams should also to liaise with the competent authorities of the country requesting assistance, where appropriate.
<P><LI>Establishment of a common emergency communication system. Aim: to develop a common operational emergency communication system between the Civil Protection administrations of the Member States and the relevant services of the Commission.
</UL><P>The intervention teams will be the core component of the mechanism. However, in managing emergencies there is always a substantial need for flexibility. Therefore, Member States and third countries will also be given the possibility of requesting other support, involving specialised personnel and specific equipment needed to deal with the particular emergency. Civil Protection authorities in the Member States, non-governmental organisations and other relevant entities, could provide these resources.
<P>Candidate Countries will be invited to participate in the mechanism. The recent experience from the earthquake in Turkey and the Dam failure in the Danube catchment area clearly indicates that the mechanism is important for these countries. Provisions for their participation have therefore been included in the Commission proposal.
<P>The overall responsibility for the emergency response measures will remain entirely with the country requesting assistance to respond to a disaster.
<P>The Community mechanism for coordination of Civil Protection intervention in the event of emergencies can also contribute to the Union's overall non-military response to crises in third countries under the common Foreign and Security Policy.
<P>The Commission proposal for a strengthened Community mechanism for Civil Protection intervention supplements the existing Community Action Programme in the field of Civil Protection (2000-2004) - see Annex. The proposed actions are not provided for in the existing action programme. Consistency and complementarity between the existing Action Programme and actions under the proposed mechanism will be ensured. 
<P><B>Annex </B>
<UL><P><B>Community Action Programme in the field of Civil Protection </B>
</UL><P>A first two-year programme was adopted on 1997 for 1998-99. It has been allocated € 3 million. A second five-year programme was adopted in 1999 for 2000-2004 with a budgetary allocation of € 7.5 million. These Community programmes in accordance with the subsidiary principle are intended to support and supplement Member States' efforts in order to make them more effective. In particular, the programme allows for extensive pooling of experience at the national level and for mutual assistance in case of need. 
<P>What has been achieved through the Action Programmes so far? 
<P>To better valorise the limited resources allocated to the Programme, the Commission in close co-operation with National Civil Protection Authorities, launched a series of Major Intergovernmental Projects aiming, mainly at establishing commonly accepted rules, guidelines and recommendations and at reinforcing networks of civil protection experts. 
<P>The two priority major projects are: 
<UL><P><B>Prevention of disasters </B>
<P><LI>This project aims, in its first stage, at establishing guidelines on the use of risk assessment techniques, on the prevention of flash floods and on the improvement of fire safety. 
<P><B>Information to the public </B>
<P><LI>This project aims at contributing, in the long term, to reach a common safer area for the 370 millions European citizens. This would be pursued by a better information of the public on risks to which they are exposed and how to behave in case of accidents and to promote common alarms and signals. 
</UL><P>An initiative to be supported under the new action programme will be the creation of a Community platform to facilitate the integration of new technologies, in particular satellite imagery and modern communication systems in the civil protection structures. 
<P>Other important projects on exchange of experts, crisis management, disaster medicine are also carried out.
