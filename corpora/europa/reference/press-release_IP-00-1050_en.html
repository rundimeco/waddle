<P><B>Commission clears Dutch mobile telephony venture between Belgacom, Tele Danmark and T-Mobile  </B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has approved the planned creation of a joint venture between the companies Belgacom N.V./S.A., Tele Danmark A/S and T-Mobile International AG, a 100% subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom AG. The new joint venture, Ben Nederland Holding B.V has been awarded one of the five third generation (3G) mobile licences in the Netherlands and will build and operate a UMTS network in the Netherlands.  The operation does not raise competitive concerns since the position of Ben will not be significant. </B></I>
