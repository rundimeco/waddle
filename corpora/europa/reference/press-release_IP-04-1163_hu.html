<h1><h3><h3>
<a name="Heading45"></a><b>Consultation</b></h3>
<p>The Commission services are interested in your views, <i>inter alia</i> on
the following questions:</p>
<ul>

remedies would you propose?</li>
<li>Q9: Does the administration of export controls and transfers of know how in
the US and the EU work satisfactorily in balancing the objectives of trade and

services of the Commission would like to receive input from this consultation
from a wide range of stakeholders with interests in the EU-US economic

</p>
<p>Your replies will help to formulate policy options which could in turn feed
into a joint strategy to enhance EU -US economic partnership an eliminate
barriers.</p>
<p>In parallel, between now and the end of November the Commission intends to
organise a stakeholder event in Brussels. It is expected that this will be
supplemented by some events organised by national Governments of member states.
These activities will give further opportunities for you to contribute your
views.</p>

<p><b>THE TRANSATLANTIC ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP</b></p>
<p>The EU and US form the largest trade and investment relationship in the world
and are each other’s largest trade and investment partners. The volume of
trade in 2003 comprised more than € 600 bn ($ 725 bn) worth of goods and
services<sup><b><a name="fnB3" href="#fn3">[3]</a></b></sup>. Large as this is,
it is now far outweighed by the flow of investment. In 2003, the EU had €
890 bn of direct investment in the US while the US had € 650 bn in the EU;
a total of over € 1.5 trillion ($ 1.8 trn). Today investment constitutes
the most significant element of our economic relationship.</p>
<p>The EU and the US have a long history of close cooperation in GATT and then
the WTO, most recently illustrated over the adoption of a new Doha Round
framework in July. This cooperation has underpinned this high level of economic
interdependence, despite the absence of any formal trade/investment agreement
between the EU and US.</p>
<p><b>THE STRUCTURE OF OUR ECONOMIC COOPERATION FRAMEWORK</b></p>
<p>With the aim of structuring discussions over issues that arise in trade, and
over steps to build closer cooperation, the EU and the US have adopted some
formal arrangements that have been built up over the past ten years. The
framework of the EU-US economic relationship goes beyond trade and investment
and includes a number of institutionalised dialogues and growing regulatory
cooperation between the partners. The main elements of this framework are
described below. The EU and the US also cooperate in numerous multilateral
organisations.</p>
<p><u>The New Transatlantic Agenda</u><b> </b>(NTA) and the accompanying
<u>EU-US Joint Action Plan</u> of December 1995 created a senior level dialogue
structure and embarked on a series of concrete cooperative endeavours. One of
the aims of the NTA is “to create a New Transatlantic Marketplace by
progressively reducing or eliminating barriers that hinder flow of goods,
services and capital between us”.</p>
<p>The <u>Transatlantic Economic Partnership</u> (TEP) agreed in May 1998 lays
the foundations to enable the EU and US to intensify their efforts to reduce or
eliminate barriers to trade and investment between them notably through closer
co-operation between regulators. It allows them to focus initiatives on areas
where there is goodwill on both sides and where gains can be enormous –
for example financial markets. It promotes upstream convergence or mutual
recognition of rules and standards; and it acts as an early warning mechanism in
case a potentially damaging piece of legislation is in the pipeline. In November
1998 the European Commission and the US Administration adopted a rolling work
programme, entitled the <u>TEP Action Plan</u>. This document identifies areas
for common actions both bilaterally and multilaterally. Some elements of the
plan take the form of trade negotiations, others are achieved through
co-operative actions. </p>
<p>In order to manage day-to-day transatlantic trade and investment relations,
the <u>TEP Steering Group </u>(SG) was set up. It monitors the realisation of
TEP objectives and provides a horizontal forum for bilateral consultation and
early warning on any matter of trade and investment relevance, with a view to
preventing conflicts and resolving trade frictions. It is also responsible for
implementing and developing the <u>Positive Economic Agenda (PEA)</u> – a
series of positive and specific trade-related initiatives designed in May 2002
to promote co-operation and mutual commercial benefit. Activities under the PEA
include the implementation of the Guidelines on Regulatory Cooperation and
Transparency, developed in 2002 under the TEP, and the Financial Markets
Dialogue, a forum for the discussion of complex bilateral financial and
regulatory issues.</p>
