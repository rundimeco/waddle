<P><B>Commission and Member States discuss competition policy in the motor fuel sector </B></H3>
<P><I><B>The Commission and Member States competition authorities met on 29 September to discuss competition policy in the motor fuel sector. Mario Monti, commissioner in charge of competition, welcomed the results of the meeting and expressed appreciation for the active contribution by the reppresentatives from the member States. </B></I><I><B>"The meeting has been a helpful means to exchange experiences and information between the competition authorities. European consumers expect  the network of national and Community competition authorities to follow current price developments closely.Today</B></I><I><B>'s meeting shows that the competition authorithies will indeed intervene immediately in case there is evidence that market operators, through restricting competition, exploit the situation for their benefit.</B></I><I><B>".   </B></I>
<P><B>Exchange of experiences</B>
<P>The <B>aim of the meeting</B> was to identify and discuss how competition policy can render the motor fuel sector more competitive and to exchange experiences in order to make the enforcement of antitrust rules at national and Community level more effective. 
<P><B>National cartel investigations</B>
<P>The meeting showed that the national competition authorities follow the developments in the motor fuel sector closely. National authorities have intervened whenever they have detected anti-competitive conduct in the market. Examples of successful interventions are the Italian and Swedish competition authorities' recent findings of cartels. 
<P>The detected cartels have been focusing on<B> fixing, directly or indirectly, prices at retail or wholesale level. </B>The participating companies have used different methods to attain the same objective, i.e. to control the dealers' margins. It must be stressed that, under competition law, retailers must be free to set prices. Where they are not free (as for example in the Italian case), price competition among the vertically integrated companies suffers.
<P>During the meeting, the national competition authorities highlighted the difficulties of applying traditional antitrust rules to parallel pricing in the motor fuel sector. Price-fixing at retail level is facilitated by the perfect price transparency. It is thus sufficient that one operator publicly announces his intention to modify his retail price for all market participants to know and to adjust. The use of Internet to publicly announce prices seems to increase this transparency even further. Such parallel behaviour is furthermore facilitated by the fact that most motor fuel markets are oligopolistic with large operators. 
<P>It was also discussed how cases are best allocated between national competition authorities and the Commission. The lack of supranational elements that appeared in the recent investigations confirms that <B>where</B> <B>price</B> <B>cartels operate in this sector in general they take place at national level</B>. Commission and Member States agreed that cartel prosecution should continue to take place at the most efficient level, which in this particular sector seems to be national level in most cases. This is fully in line with the conclusions of the on-going Modernisation reform of EC competition law.<sup><a name="file.tmp_Ref_1"><a href="#file.tmp_Foot_1">(1)</a></a></sup>.
<P><B>Importance of new entry and independent players in the market</B>
<P>The Commission and the national competition authorities agreed that <B>new entrants and independents (non-integrated companies) are essential to maintain and/or improve the competitive pressure in the European markets</B>. The experience of the Member States showed that markets where independent non-integrated operators with a countervailing buying power are present show a more competitive performance than markets where only integrated oil companies are present. In this respect, supermarkets have proven to be successful entrants in France and the U.K. at the retail level.
<P><B>Commission and Member States concluded that markets must be kept open for independents and new entrants</B>
<P>It is therefore essential that independents can gain non-discriminatory <B>access to logistic facilities </B>under reasonable conditions. This is particularly important for cross-border competition, as shown in recent merger investigations undertaken by the Commission, such as TotalFina/Elf. Independent players may also be the object of<B> abusive conduct</B> from vertically integrated refiners, in particular discriminatory pricing when buying from the latter. Abusive conduct could either take place by means of cartels or by dominant firms. <B>Access to retailing facilities </B>is equally important for new entrants. The Commission will enforce its revised policy on vertical restraints so as to avoid foreclosure effects in the national markets. It should be reminded that <B>the maximum duration of exclusive contracts has been reduced by the Commission from 10 to 5 years under the new block exemption on vertical restraints.</B>
<P><B>The Commission</B> intends <B>to further investigate the conditions of competition for independents and new entrants. </B>In this respect, the Commission has the particular task to ensure firstly that all state barriers to cross-border trade disappear and secondly that they are not replaced by barriers erected by private operators. 
<P><B>Other measures can render motor fuels market structure more competitive</B>
<P>It was also discussed at the meeting to which extent other measures can supplement competition law enforcement. Some national markets are dominated by a single supplier or a narrow oligopoly. In these instances competition law does not alone provide a satisfactory remedy. In this context, <B>the Commission invited the Member States to examine, where appropriate and possible under national legislation, to adopt other measures aimed at increasing competition in the market.</B> Such measures could, for example, include compulsory divestiture of assets (including divestiture of logistic facilities), facilitation of the establishment of new competitors at retail level (such as "white pumps") and (re-)allocation of retail outlets on the basis of competitive criteria (such as concessions for service stations on motorways or on public land in town centres).
<P><B>Follow-up </B>
<P>It was agreed at the meeting that the Commission and the national competition authorities should remain in close contact and that every opportunity for the network to act effectively together in the motor fuel sector should be used to the benefit of the European consumer. In addition to these permanent contacts, Mr. Monti has proposed that the situation in this sector may already be reviewed at the meeting of the Director-Generals of the national competition authorities and the Commssion to take place later this autumn. Mr. Monti finally stressed that: <B>"if the Commission came across any evidence of anti-competitive practice within its sphere of competence, it would not hesitate to take immediate action and impose the appropriate sanctions</B><B>". </B><p><sup><a name="file.tmp_Foot_1"><a href="#file.tmp_Ref_1">(1)</a></a></sup><SUP><B> </B></SUP><SUP><B>See IP/00/1064 of 27.09.2000.</B></SUP>
