<P><B>Commission encourages candidate countries</B><B>' companies to start preparing for the introduction of the Euro</B></H3>
<P><I><B>If companies in candidate countries feel that the </B></I><I><B>€ preparation is not a pressing issue, they are mistaken. At the latest as of 1 January 2002, all Euro-zone companies and institutions will switch all their financial transactions to the </B></I><I><B>€. In a conference organised in the framework of the EXPO 2000 in Hanover, the Commission, with the support of the European Parliament, has opened today an information campaign on the practical impact of the </B></I><I><B>€ cash changeover for candidate countries</B></I><I><B>' businesses. Companies from the EU and candidate countries, public administrations and the media will exchange views on the importance and practical and strategic implications of the final cash changeover. EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs Pedro Solbes stated that </B></I><I><B>"given the de facto increasing integration of candidate countries with the euro-zone economy, the Commission will take a pro-active approach in helping them prepare for the </B></I><I><B>€ while at the same time intensifying our information campaign for companies and citizens within Europe.</B></I><I><B>"</B></I>
<P>For candidate country companies, the same holds as for companies within the euro-zone: there is not a unique way to deal with the euro, as preparation efforts have to be adapted to the companies' individual situations. Defining a changeover strategy for Central and Eastern European companies involves a precise assessment of
<UL><P><LI>the companies' international exposure,
<P><LI>customer demand and supplier's plans,
<P><LI>competitors' strategies,
<P><LI>the availability of banking services
<P><LI>internal resources etc.
</UL><P>For each company, the impact of the € cash changeover will be proportionate to corporate exposure to foreign trade and competition. Indeed all functions of companies may be affected and require strategic adaptations to the new environment.
<P>For a start, the € will simplify daily operations and reduce costs.  One currency instead of 12 means one single bank account, if not one single bank, with automatic compensation of debit and credit balances, and a better remuneration of deposits as their consolidation will make them more sizeable. On the other hand bank borrowings in euro-zone currency for candidate country companies become cheaper as the euro market has already become larger and more liquid than yesterday's individual European currency markets.
<P>Price transparency resulting from the euro and electronic commerce will increase competition, reduce price disparities and will lead to new procurement, marketing and sales strategies.  Also prices which were customer friendly in EU national currencies will have to be adapted to new psychological thresholds when converted into €.
<P>This leap forward in European integration will have positive impact on candidate country businesses and their trade with the euro-zone.  It will take time but the first companies to adapt themselves to the new environment will undoubtedly draw the largest benefits.
