<P><B>Commission clears purchase of BASF</B><B>'s Novolen polypropylene technology business </B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has authorised the creation of a joint venture between ABB Lummus and Equistar, both of the United States, to purchase BASF</B></I><I><B>'s Novolen polypropylene (PP) technology licensing business, currently run by its subsidiary Targor. </B></I>
<P>ABB Lummus is part of the ABB Group and Equistar is partly owned by Lyondell. Since neither ABB Lummus nor Equistar are currently active in the PP technology licensing there is no overlap between the parent companies and Novolen, and the joint venture company will simply inherit BASF/Targor's market share of about 9%. The concentration will therefore not create or strengthen any dominant positions.  
<P>The Novolen business is currently owned by BASF and run by Targor.  BASF made a commitment to sell the Novolen business when it combined the remainder of its polypropylene assets with those of Shell earlier this year. This sale fulfils the conditions of that commitment.
