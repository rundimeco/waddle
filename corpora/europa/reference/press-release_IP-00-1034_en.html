<P><B>Commission proposes "Everything but Arms" (EBA) initiative: duty-free, quota-free access for all products from all least developed countries into the EU</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission today adopted a groundbreaking plan to provide full access for the world</B></I><I><B>'s poorest countries into European Union markets. The Commission</B></I><I><B>'s proposal to the Council would grant duty-free access to the world's 48 poorest countries.  The proposal would cover </B></I><I><B><U>all</U></B></I><I><B> goods except the arms trade:   </B></I><I><B>"everything but arms</B></I><I><B>".  European Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy welcomed the Commission</B></I><I><B>'s adoption of the proposal, saying: </B></I><I><B>"There has been plenty of talk about how market access for poor countries is critical if we are to tackle their growing marginalisation in the globalising economy. Everyone seems ready to make the commitment at the political level. But talk is cheap. We now need to move beyond opt-out clauses.  It</B></I><I><B>'s time to put access to our markets where our mouth is.  That means opening up across the board, and for all the poorest countries.  So we want to move to liberalise everything but the arms trade.  I hope the Council and Parliament can adopt this proposal swiftly </B></I><I><B> and that other developed countries quickly follow suit.</B></I><I><B>" </B></I>
<P>This initiative, pioneered by the EU in the run-up to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) ministerial meeting in Seattle last year, would go beyond all previous Community commitments. The proposal reflects the Commission's belief that all WTO members can and should benefit from trade liberalisation. 
<P>In 1998, the EU was already the major destination for LDC exports (56% of the total, to a value of 8714 million euro).  However, the existing regime still excludes about 10% of the 10,500 tariff lines in the Community's tariff schedule, and 1% of total trade flows.  
<P>The EU signed an agreement in June 2000 in Cotonou with African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, triggering a process that will ensure free access for "essentially all" products from all LDCs by 2005 at the latest.      
<P>But the Commission now proposes to go beyond all previous Community commitments by proposing to grant unrestricted duty-free access to <U>all</U> products (except arms) from all LDCs.  The proposal, which would extend duty and quota free access for a further 919 lines,  would come into effect as soon as it is agreed by the Council. For three products (bananas, sugar and rice) implementation will take effect in three progressive stages to be completed within three years.  This obviously covers many products which are not currently imported into the EU at present because of the high level of protection.  The proposed new list leaves out just 25 tariff lines: these relate to the arms trade, which is excluded for obvious reasons.  
<P>Mr Lamy added: "We have been through this line by line, product by product, and have concluded that we should now take this important further step. Of course, some of the products are relatively sensitive, but there is no point in offering trade concessions on products which LDCs cannot export.  We have to make a real difference. We of course recognise that duty free access alone is not enough to enable the poorest countries to benefit from liberalised trade.  We need to help them build their capacity to supply goods of export quality, and we reaffirm the Commission's commitment to continued technical and financial assistance to this end".   
<P>The Commission also hopes that the proposal will strengthen the will of LDCs to adopt policies across the board that will put their countries on the road to recovery and development.  
<P>"That means not just economic policy, but conflict prevention and resolution too, " said Mr Lamy.  <B>  </B>
