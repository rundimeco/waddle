<P><I><B>The 'Single Programming Document'</B></I><sup><a name="file.tmp_Ref_1"><a href="#file.tmp_Foot_1">(1)</a></a></sup><I><B> to support education, training and employment in Sweden over the next seven years was approved by the Commission today. With the exception of the regions covered by the Objective 1</B></I><sup><a name="file.tmp_Ref_2"><a href="#file.tmp_Foot_2">(2)</a></a></sup><I><B> Sweden is eligible for </B></I><I><B>€ 747 million in EU support under this Objective 3 programme. Today's decision is one of many currently being taken by the Commission for all Member States to launch the new Structural Funds programming period.</B></I>
<P>Welcoming the decision, Anna Diamantopoulou, Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs stated: "The new Objective 3 Single Programming Document has been tailor-made to support and develop the Swedish labour market, with some pioneering measures for skills development for employees. Measures to integrate disadvantaged groups such as immigrants, the disabled and the unemployed are also addressed in the programme. Particular emphasis is given to equal opportunities and to local development. Although the Swedish economy has recently improved and employment is rising, Sweden still faces challenges, including labour shortages and high numbers of people living on various benefits due to difficulties in obtaining work on the labour market. This programme will contribute to tackling these problems. " 
<P>The Swedish government has concentrated its economic policy on promoting high growth rates and boosting employment levels, with the aim of halving the unemployment rate to 4 % by the end of this year and increasing the employment rate to 80 % for 20-64 year olds, by 2004. The Objective 3 programme approved today will complement and support this national policy over the coming years.
<P>The Single Programming Document (SPD), the result of 7 months of negotiations between the Swedish authorities and the Commission, sets out five key priorities:
<UL><P><LI><B>To develop and upgrade the skills of employees </B>based on an analysis of activity development and skills needs of enterprises, to be carried out in agreement between employer and employees. Over half the programme funding has been allocated to developing employees' skills, more than for any other EU Member State. This priority will target employees in the public and private sectors, especially those in SMEs employing fewer than 50 staff as well as those employed in co-operatives and the self employed.  A prerequisite for financial support for projects will be the prior agreement of the social partners, or agreement between the managers and personnel involved in the project to be funded (budget: € 289 million or 38,7 % of ESF allocation).
<P><LI><B>To increase employability and entrepreneurship.</B> The aim of this priority is to strengthen the position of disadvantaged groups on the labour market by providing assistance with training, job rotation or help in starting a business. Measures will be carried out in close co-operation with local partners and employment services. Target groups include the employed, the unemployed, and the disadvantaged, who have difficulties in finding and remaining in employment (budget: € 258 million or 34.5 % of ESF allocation).
<P><LI><B>To promote integration, multiplicity and equal opportunity for all in accessing the labour market</B>. The first measures under this priority will focus on the integration of immigrants and the disabled, by providing training, skills upgrading and opportunities to start their own businesses. The second measure aims to boost the position of women on the labour market. Measures to support both men and women will apply horizontally to all the priorities, while the specific measure will aim at developing entrepreneurial skills to reduce gender segregation in the jobs market (budget: € 159 million or 21.3 % of the ESF allocation).
<P><LI><B>To support local development through local initiatives and pilot projects</B>. Funding will be allocated to small projects which can clearly be managed more effectively at a grassroots level as well as innovative measures and feasibility studies for larger projects, which could later be funded under one of the other priorities (budget: € 19 million or 2.5 % of ESF allocation).
<P><LI>A fifth priority will support <B>technical assistance measures</B>, such as management, follow-up, evaluation, control, audit, and publicity and information of all priorities. 
</UL><P>The SPD also sets out how the horizontal issues of equal opportunities between men and women, the information society, sustainable development and new employment, and regional/local development have been taken into account in the development of the programme strategy and in the criteria for project selection.
<P>The overall budget for the programme is € 2.780 million, of which € 729 million will be contributed by the Swedish public sector, € 747 million by the EU and € 1.303 million by private companies. 
<P><B>Programme management </B>
<P>The Swedish ESF Council (Svenska ESF-rådet, P.O. Box 47 141 or Liljeholmsvägen, 30, 5 tr, S-100 74 Stockholm, tel.: +46-8-579-171-00, fax: +46-8-579-171-01) will be fully responsible for managing and evaluating the programme. As the implementation of the programme is decentralised to the counties, regional units of the ESF Council will support the Regional Partnerships, which are based on the former Objective 4 partnerships. Responsibility for making payments to projects and auditing lies with the National Labour Market Board (AMS). In keeping with one of the fundamental aims of the reform of the Structural Funds, selection and management of projects will be simplified. For example, payment procedures will be accelerated and ESF support will from now on be available on a multi-annual basis.
<P>The partnership to oversee the SPD, the Monitoring Committee, will be made up of representatives of the European Commission, national authorities, social partners and relevant organisations with particular interest in the Objective 3, including the voluntary and social economy sectors. 
<P>Following today's decision, the Swedish authorities will now present to the Commission, for information only, a Programme Complement. It will complete the SPD and will set out in more detail the measures to be taken, the final beneficiaries of the funding, the criteria for choosing projects and indicators for follow-up and evaluation of the programme.
<P>As the Swedish programme is highly decentralised, the regional plans, formulated by the regional partnerships in counties, will now be adopted by the Monitoring Committee. The regional partnerships together with the regional ESF Council offices will then be able to launch the programme in their regions with calls for tenders for projects.<p><sup><a name="file.tmp_Foot_1"><a href="#file.tmp_Ref_1">(1)</a></a></sup><SUP><I><B> </B></I></SUP><SUP><I><B>The Single Programming Document sets out the strategy, priorities, objectives and expected impact of Structural Fund activities and outlines how the programmes will be managed, monitored and evaluated on the ground.</B></I></SUP><p><sup><a name="file.tmp_Foot_2"><a href="#file.tmp_Ref_2">(2)</a></a></sup><SUP><I><B>Objective 1 covers Norra Norrland and </B></I></SUP><SUP><I><B>S</B></I></SUP><SUP><I><B>ödra Skogsl</B></I></SUP><SUP><I><B>änsregionen.</B></I></SUP>
