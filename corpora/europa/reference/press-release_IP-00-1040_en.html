<P><B>Aids in favour of tobacco producers in Italy</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The Commission has decided not to raise objections with respect to a compensatory aid granted by Italy to tobacco producers who suffered severe losses of production due to an outbreak of the Potato Virus Y which affected their crops in 1997. The aid, which forms part of a regional programme for the control and eradication of the disease, will be granted to farmers who suffered losses equal at least to 30% of their normal production. It will not exceed 100% of the losses actually sustained.</B></I>
<P>According to Community policy, in general,  compensatory aids for combating animal and plant diseases should be conditional upon the preventative slaughtering of the animals or destruction of the crops carried out on the orders or recommendation of the national authorities. In the case of the authorized aid, no preventative destruction of the crops was ordered by the national authorities and farmers are compensated for the loss of income suffered as the result of the reduction in yield caused by the disease. The Commission has considered however that, unlike what happens with animal diseases, in the case of plant diseases affecting annual crops the requirement to destroy the crops is often unrealistic or even  impossible to meet on account of the specific way in which plant diseases spread and affect annual crops. 
<P>The Commission has also considered that Italy undertook a serious programme of control and eradication of the disease and that there was no risk of authorising operating aid since the aid would only be granted to farmers who suffered losses equal at least to 30% of their normal production. The 30% threshold (20% in less favoured areas) has consistently been adopted by the Commission to draw the line between operating and non operating aid in the case of adverse weather conditions such as frost, hail, rain or drought which cause damage to agricultural production or the means of agricultural production. 
<P>Pending a future revision of the Community Guidelines for State aid in the agriculture sector to clarify this aspect, from now on the Commission will also adopt this approach in similar cases.
