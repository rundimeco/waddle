<P><B>Commission Celebrates First Fully Pan-European Car Free Day </B></H3>
<P><I><B>On Friday 22 September, several members of the European Commission will join Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstr</B></I><I><B>öm in taking to their bicycles to celebrate the first genuinely pan-European Car Free Day. They will cycle to Brussels' Cinquantenaire Park to celebrate this event. Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstr</B></I><I><B>öm will also take part in an </B></I><I><B>"outside broadcast</B></I><I><B>" internet chat . Some 800 cities around, and also outside, Europe, are participating in the event. Mrs Wallstr</B></I><I><B>öm explained: " Recent events have highlighted our over-reliance on road transport as well our unsustainable dependence on one source of non-renewable energy. Although European Car Free Day has been planned for some time now, the current discussions on fuel prices make Car Free Day 2000 particularly timely. She added: This is a unique opportunity to involve citizens and local authorities in a debate on what kind of cities we want our children to grow up in. It provides us with an occasion to discuss the urban environment, air pollution in cities, and alternative forms of transport". I sincerely hope that more cities in Europe and around the world will join this initiative. </B></I>
<P>Car Free Day is a significant awareness-raising event that seeks to involve directly European citizens in environmental action. EU environmental initiatives on climate change, air quality and the urban environment provide the policy backdrop against which Car Free Day is taking place. In addition to the approval earlier this year by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament of an air quality proposal on carbon monoxide and benzene in ambient air, two other legislative initiatives (the Large Combustion Plants and the National Emissions Ceilings Directives) were approved by Environment ministers on 22 June<sup><a name="file.tmp_Ref_1"><a href="#file.tmp_Foot_1">(1)</a></a></sup>. By setting ceilings for four major pollutants, these initiatives represent a major step forward in achieving the Community's objective for the protection of human health from ground level ozone.
<P>In order to improve the environment in urban areas more generally, the Commission is also pursuing other legislative proposals in parallel. A draft framework directive on noise was adopted last July by the Commission<sup><a name="file.tmp_Ref_2"><a href="#file.tmp_Foot_2">(2)</a></a></sup> according to which noise maps based on common methods and indicators should be made available to the public and should form the basis for action plans against noise pollution.
<P>Car Free Day provides the opportunity to raise awareness and understanding of environmental action on such issues. It aims to draw the attention of the public and decision makers to the negative impact of the dominance of cars on the quality of life in our cities (80 % of the European population live in urban areas). It is estimated that around 30% of car journeys in the EU involve distances of less than 3 kilometres. 
<P>Car Free Day is therefore an opportunity to test alternative mobility concepts such as Park & Ride, expanded "pedestrian zones" and cycle friendly schemes amongst others.
<P>To celebrate the first fully pan-European Car-Free Day, several members of the European Commission will take part in a cycle ride from the Université Libre de Bruxelles domain (metro station Delta) to the Parc du Cinquantenaire, opposite the Breydel building, avenue d'Auderghem, where on-line connections with many participating cities will be established. Commissioner Wallström will also answer questions on the Car Free Day event via an "outside broadcast" internet chat at 11.00h (<A HREF="http://ec.europa.eu/chat/">http://ec.europa.eu/chat/</A>).
<P>Some 800 cities (located in 25 European countries) rallied around the European Car Free Day initiative launched by Mrs Wallström on 4th February 2000 <sup><a name="file.tmp_Ref_3"><a href="#file.tmp_Foot_3">(3)</a></a></sup> and will now participate in the event. By organising a Car Free Day, all these cities will enable their citizens to benefit from a day without the congestion, the pollution and the dangers caused by the presence and use of cars. It is estimated that in Europe alone (from Dublin and London to Athens and Rome, and from Lisbon and Madrid to Copenhagen and Helsinki) more than 65 million people will be involved in Car Free Day activities.
<P>The progress achieved since last year's pioneering event (involving 66 French and 92 Italian cities) was made possible by the active involvement of the key partners in this European initiative (national ministries and energy agencies, networks of local authorities, NGOs and the European Commission). This good example of urban governance has also inspired action by decision makers in countries and cities located outside Europe (Car Free Day was organised in Bogota last February and will take place in Buenos Aires tomorrow) a healthier urban environment".
<P>Commissioner Wallström commented: "Car-Free Days, as awareness raising events with a high degree of direct involvement of citizens, can play a part in helping to achieve our objectives on climate change, air quality, noise and quality of life in urban areas. It is extremely encouraging, this year, to see so many people join forces across Europe and beyond for a healthier urban environment".
