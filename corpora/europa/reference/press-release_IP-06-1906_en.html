resolution of the Russia-Belarus gas conflict</b></h1>
<p>The European Commissioner for Energy, Andris Piebalgs, has called today for
an urgent resolution of the negotiations between Russia and Belarus about gas
supplies for next year. "The Commission is following the situation very closely
since it may affect gas supplies to the European Union. I call the two parts to
reach as soon as possible a satisfactory agreement that do not put in question
gas transits to the EU. In any case, I will call the Gas Coordination Group to
meet on 4th January in Brussels to evaluate the situation", said Commissioner
Piebalgs. </p>
<p>The Gas Coordination Group (GCG) was established by Directive 2004/67/EC, and
deals with measures to safeguard security of natural gas supply. It is composed
by representatives of Member States, representative bodies of the industry
concerned and of relevant consumers. It is chaired by the European
Commission.</p>
<p>The GCG met last time on 6 October in Brussels, at the request of
Commissioner Piebalgs, in order to ensure that the EU can meet the demand for
gas this winter, particularly in view of last year's challenges to the security
of gas supply. For first time, the group welcomed representatives of Ukraine and
Russia. In that occasion, Gazprom representative assured that no problem of gas
supply was expected for this winter.</p>
