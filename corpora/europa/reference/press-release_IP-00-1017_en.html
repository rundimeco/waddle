<P><B>Commission clears NovaBank venture between Banco Comercial Portugues and Interamerican </B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has approved an operation by which  Portuguese bank Banco Comercial Portugues (BCP) and Greek insurance group Interamerican Hellenic Life Insurance Company SA  will acquire joint control over a newly created joint venture called NovaBank. NovaBank will be active in retail banking in Greece, where none of the founding companies are currently active. There are also no significant overlaps in the parties</B></I><I><B>' activities outside the joint venture in Greece. Therefore, the concentration will not give rise to any concerns with regard to its impact on effective competition. </B></I>
<P>BCP is the leading banking and financial services group in Portugal offering a complete range of retail banking, private banking and corporate banking products and services. Through its subsidiaries, BCP also offers insurance services and asset management. 
<P>Interamerican is one of the largest private insurance groups in Greece heading a group of companies active in life insurance and non-life insurance. 
<P>BCP has recently acquired a Portuguese company which has minor insurance activities in Greece. This does not, however, create any significant overlap with the insurance activities of Interamerican, which, through Interamerican Property&Casualty Company, has minor activities in non-life insurance in Greece. Neither are there any relevant overlaps in the parties' activities outside Greece since the parties are focused on their national markets: BCP is predominantly active in Portugal whereas Interamerican concentrates its activities on Greece.
