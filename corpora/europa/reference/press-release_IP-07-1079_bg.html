<p>През

стартира
идеята за

мрежа за
съвместна
работа на
държавите-членки
за
намирането

прагматични
решения на
проблемите,
които
гражданите и

могат за
срещнат при
трансграничните
си пътувания
или

дейност. 
Тогава
идеята бе
посрещната
скептично от
някои среди,
особено по
отношение на
неофициалния
характер на
подхода и
обявените
кратки
срокове.
Въпреки това,
през юли 2002 г. SOLVIT

SOLVIT е
възприеман

<p><br><br><br><br><b>AT – AUSTRIA</b><br><br><b><i>France lifts barrier
to market access for Austrian cheese</i></b><br><br>A French importer of
Austrian cheese was summoned by the French authorities to send a consignment of
cheese back to Austria, even though the same product had already been marketed
in France. The French authorities objected to the presence of starch in the
cheese and to the addition of 'de montagne' to the brand name. The decision was
based on French national legislation, which was in contradiction to EU law since
'de montagne' is not an 'appellation controlée,' nor did the starch in the
cheese present a danger to public health. SOLVIT France intervened and convinced
the French authorities that they should give the Austrian product full market
access. <br><br><b>Solution found within 12 weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>SOLVIT
helps Austrian citizen to get his European Health Insurance
Card</i></b><br><br>An Austrian teacher living in Austria and working in Italy
requested a European Health Insurance Card in Italy. The Italian insurance
authorities, however, refused to issue the card arguing that he should either
have his residence in Italy or be registered as tax-payer in Italy. SOLVIT found
that, in accordance to art. 14 f and art. 20 of Regulation 1408/71, the teacher
was fully entitled to obtain the card. SOLVIT Italy intervened and clarified
that a tax residence is not a condition for getting the European Health
Insurance Card. Four weeks after, the Austrian teacher obtained his card.
<br><br><b>Solved within 10 weeks.</b><br><br><br><b>BE –
BELGIUM</b><br><br><b><i>SOLVIT Netherlands helps Belgian doctor resurface from
a difficult dive</i></b><br><br>A Belgian doctor specialised in the medical
examination of divers complained that the medical certificates he issued were
not accepted in the Netherlands. The Dutch authorities required all divers not
holding Dutch certificates to be re-examined by a Dutch divers' doctor as a
condition for working in the Netherlands. SOLVIT Netherlands held intensive
negotiations with the Dutch Ministry of Employment and Social affairs and
eventually persuaded them that the Dutch rules were not in line with EU law and
had to be amended. The case was successfully concluded by a formal letter of the
Director of the department for working conditions in which he promised to revise
the rules in line with EU requirements and, as an interim solution, to issue
guidelines to the relevant instances so that they could adapt their practices
immediately based on direct application of EU treaty provisions.
<br><br><b>Solved within 14 weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>SOLVIT Portugal helps
Belgian citizen to apply for public jobs in Portugal</i></b><br><br>A Belgian
national who had been living and working in Portugal for several years was
refused access to apply for a job in a municipality because she was not
Portuguese. SOLVIT Portugal pointed out to the municipality that this was
against the EU regulations prohibiting the refusal of employment based on
nationality. Recognising their discriminatory practice, the municipality
accepted the Belgian's application and confirmed that there would be no
'Portuguese nationality' restriction on future vacancies. <br><br><b>Solved
within 6 weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><b>BG –
BULGARIA</b><br><br><b><i>Ukrainian spouse of Bulgarian national gets visa to
Spain</i></b><br><br>The Spanish embassy in Prague rejected a Ukraine national
with a Bulgarian husband an entry visa to Spain. Her request was denied due to a
two-year-old stamp in her passport from the Spanish embassy in Kiev denying an
unrelated visa request. The officer did not know what this stamp meant, but
recommended that the woman go to Kiev to remove the stamp at the Spanish
embassy. SOLVIT Czech Republic found this in breach with EU law: issuing a visa
to EU citizens' family members should be a mere formality and shouldn’t
result in the denial of entrance to an EU country, nor should its issuing be
charged by high fees or complicated by unnecessary administrative requirements.
Since the Czech SOLVIT centre's communications with the officer at the Spanish
embassy in Prague were not fruitful, SOLVIT Spain brought up the case with
authorities in Spain. Soon after, the Spanish embassy in Prague granted the
visa. <b>Solved within 4 weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><b><i>Slovakian doctor
working in Germany</i></b><br><br>A Slovakian doctor with three years of working
experience in the Czech Republic was denied recognition of her qualifications in
Germany. German authorities claimed she had not fulfilled the EC directive that
states a qualification may only be recognised if one can prove working
experience in one's own state of origin for at least 3 consecutive years during
the five years prior to requesting recognition abroad. She received no answer
after sending her diploma; a list of her subjects, exams and marks from the
University; a certificate on the working period from the Czech hospital were she
worked; and a certificate from the competent Slovak health authorities that her
qualification was compatible with EU regulations. SOLVIT determined that, as
long as Slovak health authorities agreed that she had been effectively and
lawfully engaged in the necessary activities for at least three of the past five
years, German authorities should accept this as proof of her qualification. In
conclusion, SOLVIT Germany convinced the competent authority to recognise the
Slovakian doctor's qualifications. She is now authorized to practice medicine in
Germany. <br><br><b>Solved within 3 weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><b>CY -
CYPRUS</b><br><br><b><i>Cypriot engineer registered with British
diploma</i></b><br><br>A Cypriot applied to the Cyprus Scientific and Technical
Chamber (ETEK) to register as a Mechanical Engineer with an MSc in Aeronautical
Engineering he had obtained in Bristol, the United Kingdom. He was denied due to
insufficient proof of qualification. SOLVIT Cyprus contacted ETEK to discuss the
case, promptly after which they accepted the complainant’s professional
qualifications and registered him as a Mechanical Engineer. <br><br><b>Solved
within 1 day.</b><br><br><br><b><i>UK customs authorities pay refunds to Cypriot
</i></b><br><br>A Cypriot national purchased a new car in the United Kingdom and
used it there for one month before returning back to Cyprus with it. Although he
had paid UK VAT at the time of purchase, Cypriot authorities requested another
VAT payment upon his arrival in Cyprus. Upon further investigation he found out
that, according to EU legislation, VAT should only be paid to the country of
final destination. He was therefore obliged to pay VAT in Cyprus and entitled to
a refund from the UK customs authorities, who nevertheless refused his request.
SOLVIT UK was able to clarify the position with their customs authorities and
get them to repay the VAT to the client.<b> </b><br><br><b>Case solved within 3
weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><br><b>CZ - CZECH
REPUBLIC</b><br><br><b><i>Luxembourgian Benefits for Czech
Babies</i></b><br><br>A Czech citizen living and working in Luxembourg has been
receiving Luxembourgian child benefits for his son born before he moved to
Luxembourg. Now his Czech partner is on maternity leave, for which the Czech
competent authority refuses to pay parental benefits until it is certain that
she is not receiving similar benefits from Luxembourg. The family contacted
SOLVIT because the competent Luxembourgian authorities are not answering them
about their request for parental benefits. SOLVIT Luxembourg pressed
Luxembourgian authorities on the matter, who decided to pay parental benefits to
the client, deeming it unnecessary for them to collect parental benefits from
the Czech Republic. <br><br><b>Solved within 10
weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>Czech paediatrician's degree recognized in the
UK</i></b><br><br>A Czech paediatrician's specialized degree was denied
recognition by the British General Medical Council despite the degree's
conformity with the EU Council Directive 93/16/EEC.  The problem lay in an
incorrect presentation of the degree: the Czech Ministry of Health refused to
present her with a certificate containing the name of the specialization and the
date it was awarded to her, as required by the British General Medical Council.
SOLVIT Czech Republic's intervention led the Czech Ministry of Health to provide
her with her degree confirmation in the required wording.  With that, her
paediatric qualification could be recognised in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><b>Solved within 4 weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><b>DE –
GERMANY</b><br><br><b><i>German doctor's self-employment status clarified in
Belgium </i></b><br><br>A German doctor living in Belgium opposed his
classification as a regular self-employed person in Belgium. He claimed that his
work as a doctor in Belgium had the character of a second job in addition to his
full time job in Germany. Due to the improper classification he had to pay a
social insurance in Belgium for 2003 and 2004 that was disproportionate to the
low income he had there.  The petitioner requested to be classified as an
avocational self-employed person for the years 2003 and 2004 as well as from
2005 on. Further investigation involving the Belgian national institute of
social security for independent workers, the German doctor's request was
accepted.<b> </b><br><br><b>Solved within 13 weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>German
company pipes France</i></b><br><br>A German company producing cast iron pipes
and special fittings was successfully marketing its products on the German
market as well as in seven other EEA countries. The products were produced in
Croatia and China exclusively on behalf of this company and accordance with EU
standards. Nonetheless, French authorities required further testing to be done
that would have cost the company between 30.000EUR and 40.000EUR. SOLVIT France
contacted the competent French authority, who entirely recognized the fact that
the products marketed by this company fulfilled EU norms.  In conclusion, it was
decided that the German company would not be required to engage in further
testing in order to market its products in France. <br><br><b>Solved within 14
weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><b>DK – DENMARK</b><br><br><b><i>Vann, Vand,
Vatten – It's all water after all</i></b><br><br>The Swedish daughter of a
Norwegian company importing Danish and Norwegian food into Sweden was
reprimanded in the municipality of Strömstad for labelling its products
with the Danish and Norwegian words for "water" rather than the Swedish word. 
EU regulation states the labelling should be understood by the consumer, while
Swedish regulation states that although product labelling should be in Swedish,
another language is acceptable provided the spelling is such that the consumer
can identify the product without difficulty.  The company felt that, given the
commonality of the word, the close proximity of Strömstad to Norway, and
the general familiarity of Scandinavians with the three languages across their
common borders, it should not be forced to change their labels for such a minor
detail.  When approached by SOLVIT, the municipality agreed to lift the barrier.
<br><br><b>Solved within 5 days.</b><br><br><br><b><i>Danish roofing technology
gets German green light</i></b><br><br>Three years after first trying to obtain
an approval for its fibre-cement roofing sheets in Germany, a Danish building
material company turned to SOLVIT to make sense of the many special requirements
and regulations it had been facing from German construction authorities.  As the
roofing sheets had already been approved in several EU member states, SOLVIT
confirmed that the long period of time German authorities were taking to handle
the case was contrary to the rules on free movement of goods within the EU. 
SOLVIT's intervention sped up the process – more Danish fibre-cement
roofing sheets for everybody! <br><br><b>Solved within 15
weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><br><b>EE – ESTONIA</b><br><br><b><i>Green light
for Estonian car in Finland </i></b><br><br>An Estonian citizen living and
working in Finland for two and a half years leased a car from an Estonian
leasing company for personal use in Finland. Finnish customs seized the Estonian
car claiming that, according to national taxation laws, the car could only be
released after the payment of certain car registration taxes, a large part of
which had already been paid in Estonia. After the intervention of SOLVIT
Finland, it was established that the Finnish car registration tax could be
considered an obstacle to the right of freedom of providing cross-border
services for leasing companies from EU Member States.  Taxation authorities
revisited the case and promptly issued the appropriate tax. <br><br><b>Solved
within 10 weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>Lithuanian daughter travels to Austria
with Russian mother</i></b><br><br>A Lithuanian national and her Russian mother,
both legally recognised residents of Lithuania, wished to travel to Austria
together. The Austrian Embassy in Vilnius requested the mother to present a visa
application and various additional documents concerning her living place in
Austria, invitation to Austria, financial documents, health insurance, etc.
Sensing an unnecessary lengthy treatment of the visa process, SOLVIT Austria
requested a facilitated visa procedure which was granted after certain
conditions regarding the process were clarified between both parties.
<br><br><b>Solved within 3 weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><b>EL –
GREECE</b><br><br><b><i>Greek citizen helped out of taxation
trap</i></b><br><br>A Greek citizen had a temporary job in Denmark for three
months and continued his stay in Denmark as a student. He had to pay taxes on
the temporary income but could not benefit from the lower tax rate of 8% that
applies for yearly income below 36.000 DKr for Danish tax payers. SOLVIT helped
to clarify that the fact that the Greek citizen continued to reside in Denmark
should be taken into account so that he could claim reimbursement of some of the
tax already paid under the same rule as applicable for other Danish residents.
<br><br><b>Solved within 3 weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><b><i>Cypriot residence
permit for Greek claimant of social welfare  </i></b><br><br>A Greek national
acquired a Cypriot work permit upon moving to Cyprus. The following year, he
suffered a serious industrial accident which permanently incapacitated him from
work. Since then, the complainant had been drawing a disability pension from the
Cypriot social security fund. He then applied for an additional public pension
from the social welfare office, for which he was asked to present a resident
permit. However, the Civil Registry and Migration Department refused to issue
this permit because he was not employed. Seeking a way out, the Greek man turned
to SOLVIT. SOLVIT's intervention convinced the Civil Registry and Migration
Department to issue the residence permit, allowing him to continue with his
application for social welfare public pension. <br><br><b>Solved within 4
weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><b>ES – SPAIN</b><br><br><b><i>Spanish worker
gets his pension from Germany </i></b><br><br>A Spanish citizen had worked for
some time in Germany and applied for a pension through the Spanish Social
Security Institute, INSS. German authorities refused his application, pointing
out that the contributions to his pension, i.e. DM1530.31, had already been
returned to him via the Spanish pension authorities. The Spanish citizen
insisted that he had never received the money. Following SOLVIT Germany’s
intervention it was established that the Spanish citizen had indeed never
received said contributions. The German authority confirmed that the pension
would be reimbursed. <br><br><b>Solved within 10
weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>Recognising work experience across the EU thanks to
SOLVIT</i></b><br><br>A Spanish citizen wished to have her professional
experience as residential social worker in United Kingdom recognized in order to
skip the practical modules of a specific training she was following in Spain.
However, the competent authority argued that they could not take into
consideration her experience in the United Kingdom because this could not be
proved with the appropriate Spanish certificate for working experience. SOLVIT
Spain contacted the authorities to convince them that the E301 form submitted by
the social worker was equivalent to the Spanish 'vida laboral' and should
therefore be accepted. <br><br><b>Solved within 8 weeks.</b><br><br><br><b>FI
– FINLAND</b><br><br><b><i>SOLVIT Spain helps Finnish citizens to overcome
bureaucratic hurdles</i></b><br><br>A Finnish pensioner had been living in Spain
for 8 years. Whenever she returned to Finland for a vacation, she received the
European Health Insurance Card from the Spanish health insurance authorities but
with duration of only for 3 months. This was not convenient since she wanted to
stay in Finland for a longer period. Moreover, Spanish pensioners received the
same card with a validity of 2 to 4 years. SOLVIT Spain contacted the relevant
authority about this discriminatory treatment and persuaded them introduce the
same rule for both Spanish and other EU pensioners. As a result all applicants
now receive the health insurance card with duration of one year.
<br><br><b>Solved within one day.</b><br><br><br><b><i>Finnish dental
practitioner can take up job in Spain thanks to SOLVIT</i></b><br><b>  </b><br>A
Finnish citizen had applied for professional recognition as a dental
practitioner in Spain. She did not receive a reply for many months and finally
she contacted SOLVIT for help. SOLVIT Spain found out that there had been a
misunderstanding about the procedure to be followed and they succeeded in
speeding up the decision of the ministry so that the Finnish dental practitioner
could start working in Spain. <br><br><b>Solved within one
day.</b><br><br><br><br><b>FR – FRANCE</b><br><br><b><i>SOLVIT Netherlands
helps French citizen obtain car tax reimbursement</i></b><br><b> </b><br>A
French citizen bought a new car in France where he also registered it and paid
VAT. He then moved to the Netherlands with his car and registered it in his new
place of residence. Dutch authorities asked him to pay the Dutch VAT and advised
him to ask French authorities for the reimbursement of the French VAT. This
request was contrary to EU law, since a change of residence does not justify the
levying of a VAT. After the intervention of the Dutch SOLVIT centre, the Dutch
competent authorities announced that they will reimburse the amount of VAT paid
in the Netherlands to the client. <br><br><b>Solved within 7
weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>French citizen receives social security benefits in
the Netherlands</i></b><br><br>A French citizen married to a Dutchman moved to
the Netherlands where she wished to request unemployment benefits. In order to
get these benefits, the French authorities needed to grant her specific form
that would enable her to keep her rights while moving to the Netherlands. The
French competent authority initially refused to deliver the document –
contrary to what is foreseen by EU law on coordination of social security
rights. Thanks to the intervention of SOLVIT, that authority finally agreed to
send the form, ensuring her social security and unemployment benefits throughout
the EU. <br><br><b>Solved within 2 weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><br><b>HU -
HUNGARY</b><br><br><b><i>SOLVIT Ireland helps Hungarian doctor get his diploma
recognised </i></b><br><br>A Hungarian doctor requested recognition of his
medical diploma in Ireland. The Irish Medical Council refused the request,
requiring further documents. While the doctor had received his diploma in 1985
before the date of required recognition of EU diplomas, he could prove that he
had effectively and lawfully been exercising his profession for at least the
required minimum period. EU directives state that his working experience should
suffice for recognition of his qualifications. After the Irish SOLVIT Centre
contacted the Irish Medical Council, the Hungarian doctor was granted full
registration. <br><br><b>Solved within 3 weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>French sick
leave paid to Hungarian sailor</i></b><br><br>A Hungarian sailor had been
working in France for one month when he became ill. After completing what he
thought to be the necessary sickness leave forms, French authorities refused him
his sick-leave payment. Unable to further advance in the matter, he contacted
SOLVIT. After investigating the case and communicating with the proper French
authorities, SOLVIT identified the missing forms, enabling the sailor to obtain
his sick-leave payments. <br><br><b>Solved within 4
weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><b>IE – IRELAND</b><br><br><b><i>Irish mortgages
meet French taxes</i></b><br><br>An Irish woman wished to invest in property in
France for which she wanted to take out a mortgage with an Irish mortgage
provider. The French Finance Ministry informed her that the mortgage interest on
the rental income would not be treated as deductible when assessing liability to
income tax in France. However, if she were to take out a mortgage with a French
mortgage agent, the mortgage interest on the rental income would be treated as
deductible.<br>After investigating the case, SOLVIT found that revenues deriving
from French sources should be determined in equal terms whether the owner does
or does not have his/her fiscal residence in France. As there should be no
condition tied to nationality or quality of the loaner, the interests of the
debts constricted by a non-residing taxpayer to an Irish establishment for the
conservation, acquisition, repairing or the improvement of a property are
admitted to tax inference; SOLVIT determined there should be no problem for the
Irish woman's Irish mortgage payment interests to be tax deductible in France.
<br><br><b>Solved within 8 weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>SOLVIT defends the rights
of Irish citizens' spouses </i></b><br><br>While flying between St. Petersburg
and Ireland, an Irish citizen and his Russian spouse had a two-hour stopover in
a Prague airport. Bad weather delayed their arrival in Prague, causing them to
miss their connecting flight home to Ireland. Czech immigration authorities
refused the Irish citizen's non-EU spouse her transit visa, despite the
presentation of both passports, the Russian wife's Irish Immigration card, and
her third country national visa stating that she is the legitimate Spouse of an
Irish Citizen. They were forced to spend the night in the airport. After being
contacted by SOLVIT, the Czech Ministry of Interior admitted that refusal to
issue the visa to the client was not consistent with Czech legislation or
appropriate procedures, and that it should not happen again. The approach of the
Czech custom official was purely an individual failure and was not a consequence
of structural problems concerning domestic legislation or the application of
appropriate regulations. The couple accepted the apology presented by the
Ministry. <br><br><b>Solved within 3 weeks.</b> <br><br><br><br><b>IS –
ICELAND</b><br><br><b><i>Icelandic citizen residing in Austria can still use his
driver's license </i></b><br><br>An Icelandic citizen residing in Austria had a
valid Icelandic driving licence. Austrian authorities informed him that, as he
had been residing in Austria for more than six months, his Icelandic driving
licence had automatically expired and he would consequently have to request a
new Austrian driving licence. After the intervention of the Austrian
SOLVIT-centre, it was clarified that the EU-rules on the mutual recognition of
driving licences had been incorporated into the EEA agreement, obliging Austrian
authorities to acknowledge the Icelandic driving licence. <br><br><b>Solution
found within 5 weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>Icelandic doctor can start work in

<p><b><i>Italian diploma recognised in Portugal</i></b></p>
<p>An Italian social worker who previously worked in youth development
programmes in Portugal moved to Portugal volunteer in a cultural centre
promoting social integration, citizenship formation and multicultural activities
and exchanges. Soon afterwards she was offered a paid professional traineeship
at the centre as Manager of European Projects for Youngsters promoting European
interchanges and multilingual intercultural activities. In order to begin her
professional traineeship, she was requested to provide a Portuguese approval
document of her Italian diploma. Getting her diploma recognised proved to be a
lengthy and costly process, prompting her to contact SOLVIT. SOLVIT made use of
its contacts in NARIC, a network which facilitates the integration of EU
education systems, and obtained a formal declaration stating the validity of the
Italian diploma. This declaration was accepted, enabling her to begin work at
the cultural association immediately. </p>

to get car tax exemption in Portugal </i></b><br><br>An Italian couple took up
residence in Portugal and left their classic car in Italy with their sons. After
three years they decided to bring the car to Portugal for their own use. The car
was impounded by the Portuguese authorities because it had not been registered
in Portugal and the 30% registration tax had not been paid. While Portuguese law
foresees a period of six months for registering a car imported from another EU
country, the authorities counted this period from the date of formal residence
of the couple in Portugal, not the actual date of transfer of the car from Italy
to Portugal several years later. As a result, the couple had to pay a 9.800 EUR
tax plus fine for a 20-year-old car with a value of 1.000 EUR. After the
intervention of SOLVIT Portugal, the authorities accepted to take the age of the
car into account and exempted the Italian couple from paying the tax.

years he worked there because he allegedly had not contributed to any EU
country's social security funding at least two years in the last 15 years before
retiring.  Further investigation revealed that Dutch authorities had not
provided Spain with the proper proof of the retiree's contribution to the Dutch

outsource certain tasks to China nonetheless led Czech authorities to warn that
they would withdraw their former observation of mutual recognition. Czech
authorities were concerned that the quality of the company's inspections could
suffer as a result of their partial outsourcing. Seeing as only the marking, not
the laboratory work, was scheduled for outsourcing, Dutch authorities did not
see a reason to withdraw the company's operational licence, deeming the Czech
reaction contrary to EC legislation on mutual recognition. After it was
guaranteed that the company would agree to transparency in its overseas

should be understood by the consumer, while Swedish regulation states that
although product labelling should be in Swedish, another language is acceptable
provided the spelling is such that the consumer can identify the product without
difficulty.  The company felt that, given the commonality of the word, the close
proximity of Strömstad to Norway, and the general familiarity of

not be forced to change their labels for such a minor detail.  When approached

authorities requested the applicant to provide an official confirmation that the
vehicle had been previously registered in Belgium. However, the competent
registration office in Belgium refused to issue such confirmation on a request
of a private person, maintaining that such a request had to be made directly by
Polish authorities. Polish authorities refused to make such a request, as
according to Polish traffic law, the applicant himself should present all the
necessary documents. As a result, the applicant couldn’t register the car.
Thanks to intervention of SOLVIT Poland and Polish transportation authorities,
it was found that the Polish traffic law was not in line with the EC directive
in cases where the registration documents had been stolen or lost. Polish
transportation authorities adopted amendments to the regulation which clearly
state that when registration documents have been lost or stolen, Polish
