<P><B>John Cushnahan MEP to head the EU-Sri Lankan election observation mission</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The Commission has appointed John Cushnahan, Member of the European Parliament, as Chief Observer for the forthcoming mission to observe the parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka on 10 October.    </B></I>
<P>Commissioner for External Relations, Chris Patten' said: "I am very pleased that John Cushnahan has agreed to lead the EU mission. He is a politician I know well and admire. There can be few Irish politicians who can boast such a long and varied experience of election involvement at the political coal-face, and he has been an elected representative in two countries - Ireland, and  the United Kingdom -  as well as at EU level. I wish him and his team all good luck in a what will be an interesting and sensitive mission.  
<P>The people of Sri Lanka are justifiably proud of the country's long record of democratic elections.  In Sri Lanka, the EU will  not therefore be observing a country taking its first steps towards genuine democracy or emerging from a conflict.  But these elections are taking place in an atmosphere of violence and intimidation.  Recent polls, and the frauds  which have taken place, have begun to undermine the democratic reflex which has prevailed in Sri Lanka for decades.  We hope that international observation, by its very presence, can contribute to reducing the possibility of electoral fraud and irregularities, as well as the tension and political violence we have already seen begin to  re-emerge in this campaign.  It would be tragic if this spiral of violence meant that the people of Sri Lanka lost confidence in the democrqtic process."
<P>The EU observation mission will comprise a core team of 6, including the Chief Observer, 28 campaign observers to be based in Colombo and regional centres in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Kurunegala, Kandy, Badula and Matara, and be present in Sri Lanka for a month from 19 September.  A further 40 observers will observe the run-up to the poll, and the polling day itself.  
<P>The EU team is observing the elections at the invitation of, but independent of, the Sri Lankan Elections Commissioner Mr Dayananda Dissanayake.  He has also invited the Commonwealth and the Association of Asian Election Authorities to send observers.
<P>John Cushnahan has been a Fine Gael Member of the European Parliament since 1989, representing Munster Constituency, Republic of Ireland.  He is a member of the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, and rapporteur for the Parliament on Hong Kong.
