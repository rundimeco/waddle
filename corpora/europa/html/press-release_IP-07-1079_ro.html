<h1>
<a name="Heading4"></a><b>SOLVIT: </b><b>Cinci ani de succese în
soluţionarea mai rapidă de probleme concrete în
Europa</b></h1>
<h2>
<a name="Heading7"></a><b><i>De la înfiinţarea sa în 2002,
reţeaua SOLVIT a UE le-a furnizat celor care locuiesc, muncesc,
studiază sau fac afaceri în altă ţară din uniune
decât ţara natală soluţii rapide şi eficiente pentru
mai mult de 1 800 de probleme concrete.</i></b><b><i> Aceste probleme apar
în cazurile în care administraţiile naţionale aplică
incorect legislaţia comunitară şi le refuză
cetăţenilor şi întreprinderilor drepturile pe care
aceştia le au pe piaţa unică. De exemplu, SOLVIT a facilitat unei
companii austriece comercializarea de brânză în Franţa, unui
frizer britanic - deschiderea unui salon de coafură în Germania
şi unui medic maghiar – posibilitatea de a lucra în Irlanda.
SOLVIT intenţionează acum să valorifice aceste succese
sporindu-şi capacitatea şi asigurându-se că serviciul este
cunoscut de mai multe persoane.</i></b></h2>
<p>Charlie McCreevy, Comisarul pentru Piaţa Internă şi Servicii,
a declarat: <i>„În ultimii cinci ani, SOLVIT a furnizat soluţii
reale pentru sute de probleme reale în Europa. De asemenea, prin reunirea
informală a tuturor părţilor interesate, soluţiile sunt
furnizate în câteva săptămâni, nu ani. Este un foarte
bun exemplu de conlucrare între UE şi statele membre. Peste 1 800 de
europeni pot acum face mai mult pe piaţa unică datorită SOLVIT
– sper ca următorii cinci ani să se dovedească chiar mai
reuşiţi.”</i></p>
<p>În noiembrie 2001, Comisia Europeană a prezentat pentru prima
dată ideea unei reţele eficiente, nebirocratice, în cadrul
căreia statele membre să poată conlucra pentru a găsi
soluţii rapide şi practice la problemele cu care cetăţenii
şi întreprinderile din UE se pot confrunta când se mută sau
fac afaceri peste graniţă. Atunci, ideea a fost
întâmpinată cu scepticism în unele medii, în special
în ceea ce priveşte caracterul neoficial al abordării şi
termenele scurte care trebuiau respectate. Cu toate acestea, în iulie 2002,
reţeaua SOLVIT era înfiinţată şi funcţiona,
furnizând soluţii reale în termene scurte. Astăzi, SOLVIT
este privită ca un excelent model de cooperare eficientă între
statele membre într-o varietate de domenii politice.</p>
<p><b>Cele cinci chei ale succesului SOLVIT</b></p>
<p>În ultimii cinci ani, SOLVIT şi-a căpătat reputaţia
de reţea eficientă de soluţionare a problemelor
datorită:</p>
<ol>
<li>angajamentului său pentru apărarea drepturilor europene ale
cetăţenilor şi întreprinderilor;</li>
<li>accentului pus pe soluţii rapide şi pragmatice cu ajutorul unei
baze de date online de procesare a cazurilor;</li>
<li>cunoaşterii legislaţiei UE şi a accesului la consultanţa
acordată de experţii Comisiei;</li></ol><p></p>
<ol>
<li>puternicei reţele de contacte cu autorităţile relevante la
nivel naţional;</li>
<li>spiritului de echipă şi relaţiilor de lucru
prietenoase.</li></ol><p><b>Principalele provocări pentru viitor ale
SOLVIT</b></p>
<p>În viitor, SOLVIT intenţionează să continue să
furnizeze servicii de înaltă clasă. În acest scop, centrele
naţionale trebuie să deţină suficient personal pentru a fi
capabilă să soluţioneze numărul tot mai mare de probleme
care le sunt supuse atenţiei. În plus, prin activităţi
îmbunătăţite de promovare, tot mai mulţi
cetăţeni şi întreprinderi trebuie să afle de
existenţa SOLVIT.</p>
<p><b>Fapte şi cifre</b></p>
<ul>
<li>În 2002 SOLVIT a înregistrat aproximativ 10 noi cazuri pe
lună; cinci ani mai târziu, acest număr a crescut la 60.</li>
<li>În ultimii cinci ani, rata medie de soluţionare a cazurilor SOLVIT
a rămas stabilă, de 80%. </li>
<li>Din numărul total de cazuri soluţionate, 71% au fost
soluţionate în termenul de zece săptămâni stabilit de
SOLVIT. </li>
<li>Perioada medie pentru procesarea cazurilor a scăzut semnificativ, de la
o medie de 79 de zile în 2002, la 54 de zile în 2006.</li>
<li>Două treimi din cazurile SOLVIT au fost înaintate de
cetăţeni. Principalele domenii problematice pentru cetăţeni
au vizat asigurările sociale, fiscalitatea şi recunoaşterea
calificărilor profesionale.</li>
<li>O treime din cazurile SOLVIT au fost înaintate de întreprinderi.
Principalele lor domenii problematice sunt fiscalitatea, accesul pe
piaţă al produselor, furnizarea de servicii şi libertatea de
înfiinţare.</li></ul><p><b>Servicii UE conexe</b></p>
<p>SOLVIT face parte dintr-un pachet de servicii gratuite care au ca scop
ajutarea cetăţenilor şi a întreprinderilor să
beneficieze la maxim de drepturile lor europene, printre aceste servicii
numărându-se Europe Direct, portalul de informaţii Your Europe
(<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/youreurope">http://ec.europa.eu/youreurope</a>)
şi serviciul Citizens Signpost (<a
href="http://ec.europa.eu/citizensrights">http://ec.europa.eu/citizensrights</a>)
care acordă consultanţă juridică personalizată.</p>
<p><b>Cum se utilizează SOLVIT</b></p>
<p>În cazul în care se confruntă cu o problemă
<b>transfrontalieră</b> cauzată de <b>aplicarea incorectă a
normelor UE</b> de către o autoritate publică la nivel naţional,
regional sau local, cetăţenii sau întreprinderile pot completa o
reclamaţie online sau pot contacta centrul lor naţional SOLVIT prin

<p><br><br><br><br><b>AT – AUSTRIA</b><br><br><b><i>France lifts barrier
to market access for Austrian cheese</i></b><br><br>A French importer of
Austrian cheese was summoned by the French authorities to send a consignment of
cheese back to Austria, even though the same product had already been marketed
in France. The French authorities objected to the presence of starch in the
cheese and to the addition of 'de montagne' to the brand name. The decision was
based on French national legislation, which was in contradiction to EU law since
'de montagne' is not an 'appellation controlée,' nor did the starch in the
cheese present a danger to public health. SOLVIT France intervened and convinced
the French authorities that they should give the Austrian product full market
access. <br><br><b>Solution found within 12 weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>SOLVIT
helps Austrian citizen to get his European Health Insurance
Card</i></b><br><br>An Austrian teacher living in Austria and working in Italy
requested a European Health Insurance Card in Italy. The Italian insurance
authorities, however, refused to issue the card arguing that he should either
have his residence in Italy or be registered as tax-payer in Italy. SOLVIT found
that, in accordance to art. 14 f and art. 20 of Regulation 1408/71, the teacher
was fully entitled to obtain the card. SOLVIT Italy intervened and clarified
that a tax residence is not a condition for getting the European Health
Insurance Card. Four weeks after, the Austrian teacher obtained his card.
<br><br><b>Solved within 10 weeks.</b><br><br><br><b>BE –
BELGIUM</b><br><br><b><i>SOLVIT Netherlands helps Belgian doctor resurface from
a difficult dive</i></b><br><br>A Belgian doctor specialised in the medical
examination of divers complained that the medical certificates he issued were
not accepted in the Netherlands. The Dutch authorities required all divers not
holding Dutch certificates to be re-examined by a Dutch divers' doctor as a
condition for working in the Netherlands. SOLVIT Netherlands held intensive
negotiations with the Dutch Ministry of Employment and Social affairs and
eventually persuaded them that the Dutch rules were not in line with EU law and
had to be amended. The case was successfully concluded by a formal letter of the
Director of the department for working conditions in which he promised to revise
the rules in line with EU requirements and, as an interim solution, to issue
guidelines to the relevant instances so that they could adapt their practices
immediately based on direct application of EU treaty provisions.
<br><br><b>Solved within 14 weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>SOLVIT Portugal helps
Belgian citizen to apply for public jobs in Portugal</i></b><br><br>A Belgian
national who had been living and working in Portugal for several years was
refused access to apply for a job in a municipality because she was not
Portuguese. SOLVIT Portugal pointed out to the municipality that this was
against the EU regulations prohibiting the refusal of employment based on
nationality. Recognising their discriminatory practice, the municipality
accepted the Belgian's application and confirmed that there would be no
'Portuguese nationality' restriction on future vacancies. <br><br><b>Solved
within 6 weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><b>BG –
BULGARIA</b><br><br><b><i>Ukrainian spouse of Bulgarian national gets visa to
Spain</i></b><br><br>The Spanish embassy in Prague rejected a Ukraine national
with a Bulgarian husband an entry visa to Spain. Her request was denied due to a
two-year-old stamp in her passport from the Spanish embassy in Kiev denying an
unrelated visa request. The officer did not know what this stamp meant, but
recommended that the woman go to Kiev to remove the stamp at the Spanish
embassy. SOLVIT Czech Republic found this in breach with EU law: issuing a visa
to EU citizens' family members should be a mere formality and shouldn’t
result in the denial of entrance to an EU country, nor should its issuing be
charged by high fees or complicated by unnecessary administrative requirements.
Since the Czech SOLVIT centre's communications with the officer at the Spanish
embassy in Prague were not fruitful, SOLVIT Spain brought up the case with
authorities in Spain. Soon after, the Spanish embassy in Prague granted the
visa. <b>Solved within 4 weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><b><i>Slovakian doctor
working in Germany</i></b><br><br>A Slovakian doctor with three years of working
experience in the Czech Republic was denied recognition of her qualifications in
Germany. German authorities claimed she had not fulfilled the EC directive that
states a qualification may only be recognised if one can prove working
experience in one's own state of origin for at least 3 consecutive years during
the five years prior to requesting recognition abroad. She received no answer
after sending her diploma; a list of her subjects, exams and marks from the
University; a certificate on the working period from the Czech hospital were she
worked; and a certificate from the competent Slovak health authorities that her
qualification was compatible with EU regulations. SOLVIT determined that, as
long as Slovak health authorities agreed that she had been effectively and
lawfully engaged in the necessary activities for at least three of the past five
years, German authorities should accept this as proof of her qualification. In
conclusion, SOLVIT Germany convinced the competent authority to recognise the
Slovakian doctor's qualifications. She is now authorized to practice medicine in
Germany. <br><br><b>Solved within 3 weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><b>CY -
CYPRUS</b><br><br><b><i>Cypriot engineer registered with British
diploma</i></b><br><br>A Cypriot applied to the Cyprus Scientific and Technical
Chamber (ETEK) to register as a Mechanical Engineer with an MSc in Aeronautical
Engineering he had obtained in Bristol, the United Kingdom. He was denied due to
insufficient proof of qualification. SOLVIT Cyprus contacted ETEK to discuss the
case, promptly after which they accepted the complainant’s professional
qualifications and registered him as a Mechanical Engineer. <br><br><b>Solved
within 1 day.</b><br><br><br><b><i>UK customs authorities pay refunds to Cypriot
</i></b><br><br>A Cypriot national purchased a new car in the United Kingdom and
used it there for one month before returning back to Cyprus with it. Although he
had paid UK VAT at the time of purchase, Cypriot authorities requested another
VAT payment upon his arrival in Cyprus. Upon further investigation he found out
that, according to EU legislation, VAT should only be paid to the country of
final destination. He was therefore obliged to pay VAT in Cyprus and entitled to
a refund from the UK customs authorities, who nevertheless refused his request.
SOLVIT UK was able to clarify the position with their customs authorities and
get them to repay the VAT to the client.<b> </b><br><br><b>Case solved within 3
weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><br><b>CZ - CZECH
REPUBLIC</b><br><br><b><i>Luxembourgian Benefits for Czech
Babies</i></b><br><br>A Czech citizen living and working in Luxembourg has been
receiving Luxembourgian child benefits for his son born before he moved to
Luxembourg. Now his Czech partner is on maternity leave, for which the Czech
competent authority refuses to pay parental benefits until it is certain that
she is not receiving similar benefits from Luxembourg. The family contacted
SOLVIT because the competent Luxembourgian authorities are not answering them
about their request for parental benefits. SOLVIT Luxembourg pressed
Luxembourgian authorities on the matter, who decided to pay parental benefits to
the client, deeming it unnecessary for them to collect parental benefits from
the Czech Republic. <br><br><b>Solved within 10
weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>Czech paediatrician's degree recognized in the
UK</i></b><br><br>A Czech paediatrician's specialized degree was denied
recognition by the British General Medical Council despite the degree's
conformity with the EU Council Directive 93/16/EEC.  The problem lay in an
incorrect presentation of the degree: the Czech Ministry of Health refused to
present her with a certificate containing the name of the specialization and the
date it was awarded to her, as required by the British General Medical Council.
SOLVIT Czech Republic's intervention led the Czech Ministry of Health to provide
her with her degree confirmation in the required wording.  With that, her
paediatric qualification could be recognised in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><b>Solved within 4 weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><b>DE –
GERMANY</b><br><br><b><i>German doctor's self-employment status clarified in
Belgium </i></b><br><br>A German doctor living in Belgium opposed his
classification as a regular self-employed person in Belgium. He claimed that his
work as a doctor in Belgium had the character of a second job in addition to his
full time job in Germany. Due to the improper classification he had to pay a
social insurance in Belgium for 2003 and 2004 that was disproportionate to the
low income he had there.  The petitioner requested to be classified as an
avocational self-employed person for the years 2003 and 2004 as well as from
2005 on. Further investigation involving the Belgian national institute of
social security for independent workers, the German doctor's request was
accepted.<b> </b><br><br><b>Solved within 13 weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>German
company pipes France</i></b><br><br>A German company producing cast iron pipes
and special fittings was successfully marketing its products on the German
market as well as in seven other EEA countries. The products were produced in
Croatia and China exclusively on behalf of this company and accordance with EU
standards. Nonetheless, French authorities required further testing to be done
that would have cost the company between 30.000EUR and 40.000EUR. SOLVIT France
contacted the competent French authority, who entirely recognized the fact that
the products marketed by this company fulfilled EU norms.  In conclusion, it was
decided that the German company would not be required to engage in further
testing in order to market its products in France. <br><br><b>Solved within 14
weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><b>DK – DENMARK</b><br><br><b><i>Vann, Vand,
Vatten – It's all water after all</i></b><br><br>The Swedish daughter of a
Norwegian company importing Danish and Norwegian food into Sweden was
reprimanded in the municipality of Strömstad for labelling its products
with the Danish and Norwegian words for "water" rather than the Swedish word. 
EU regulation states the labelling should be understood by the consumer, while
Swedish regulation states that although product labelling should be in Swedish,
another language is acceptable provided the spelling is such that the consumer
can identify the product without difficulty.  The company felt that, given the
commonality of the word, the close proximity of Strömstad to Norway, and
the general familiarity of Scandinavians with the three languages across their
common borders, it should not be forced to change their labels for such a minor
detail.  When approached by SOLVIT, the municipality agreed to lift the barrier.
<br><br><b>Solved within 5 days.</b><br><br><br><b><i>Danish roofing technology
gets German green light</i></b><br><br>Three years after first trying to obtain
an approval for its fibre-cement roofing sheets in Germany, a Danish building
material company turned to SOLVIT to make sense of the many special requirements
and regulations it had been facing from German construction authorities.  As the
roofing sheets had already been approved in several EU member states, SOLVIT
confirmed that the long period of time German authorities were taking to handle
the case was contrary to the rules on free movement of goods within the EU. 
SOLVIT's intervention sped up the process – more Danish fibre-cement
roofing sheets for everybody! <br><br><b>Solved within 15
weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><br><b>EE – ESTONIA</b><br><br><b><i>Green light
for Estonian car in Finland </i></b><br><br>An Estonian citizen living and
working in Finland for two and a half years leased a car from an Estonian
leasing company for personal use in Finland. Finnish customs seized the Estonian
car claiming that, according to national taxation laws, the car could only be
released after the payment of certain car registration taxes, a large part of
which had already been paid in Estonia. After the intervention of SOLVIT
Finland, it was established that the Finnish car registration tax could be
considered an obstacle to the right of freedom of providing cross-border
services for leasing companies from EU Member States.  Taxation authorities
revisited the case and promptly issued the appropriate tax. <br><br><b>Solved
within 10 weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>Lithuanian daughter travels to Austria
with Russian mother</i></b><br><br>A Lithuanian national and her Russian mother,
both legally recognised residents of Lithuania, wished to travel to Austria
together. The Austrian Embassy in Vilnius requested the mother to present a visa
application and various additional documents concerning her living place in
Austria, invitation to Austria, financial documents, health insurance, etc.
Sensing an unnecessary lengthy treatment of the visa process, SOLVIT Austria
requested a facilitated visa procedure which was granted after certain
conditions regarding the process were clarified between both parties.
<br><br><b>Solved within 3 weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><b>EL –
GREECE</b><br><br><b><i>Greek citizen helped out of taxation
trap</i></b><br><br>A Greek citizen had a temporary job in Denmark for three
months and continued his stay in Denmark as a student. He had to pay taxes on
the temporary income but could not benefit from the lower tax rate of 8% that
applies for yearly income below 36.000 DKr for Danish tax payers. SOLVIT helped
to clarify that the fact that the Greek citizen continued to reside in Denmark
should be taken into account so that he could claim reimbursement of some of the
tax already paid under the same rule as applicable for other Danish residents.
<br><br><b>Solved within 3 weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><b><i>Cypriot residence
permit for Greek claimant of social welfare  </i></b><br><br>A Greek national
acquired a Cypriot work permit upon moving to Cyprus. The following year, he
suffered a serious industrial accident which permanently incapacitated him from
work. Since then, the complainant had been drawing a disability pension from the
Cypriot social security fund. He then applied for an additional public pension
from the social welfare office, for which he was asked to present a resident
permit. However, the Civil Registry and Migration Department refused to issue
this permit because he was not employed. Seeking a way out, the Greek man turned
to SOLVIT. SOLVIT's intervention convinced the Civil Registry and Migration
Department to issue the residence permit, allowing him to continue with his
application for social welfare public pension. <br><br><b>Solved within 4
weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><b>ES – SPAIN</b><br><br><b><i>Spanish worker
gets his pension from Germany </i></b><br><br>A Spanish citizen had worked for
some time in Germany and applied for a pension through the Spanish Social
Security Institute, INSS. German authorities refused his application, pointing
out that the contributions to his pension, i.e. DM1530.31, had already been
returned to him via the Spanish pension authorities. The Spanish citizen
insisted that he had never received the money. Following SOLVIT Germany’s
intervention it was established that the Spanish citizen had indeed never
received said contributions. The German authority confirmed that the pension
would be reimbursed. <br><br><b>Solved within 10
weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>Recognising work experience across the EU thanks to
SOLVIT</i></b><br><br>A Spanish citizen wished to have her professional
experience as residential social worker in United Kingdom recognized in order to
skip the practical modules of a specific training she was following in Spain.
However, the competent authority argued that they could not take into
consideration her experience in the United Kingdom because this could not be
proved with the appropriate Spanish certificate for working experience. SOLVIT
Spain contacted the authorities to convince them that the E301 form submitted by
the social worker was equivalent to the Spanish 'vida laboral' and should
therefore be accepted. <br><br><b>Solved within 8 weeks.</b><br><br><br><b>FI
– FINLAND</b><br><br><b><i>SOLVIT Spain helps Finnish citizens to overcome
bureaucratic hurdles</i></b><br><br>A Finnish pensioner had been living in Spain
for 8 years. Whenever she returned to Finland for a vacation, she received the
European Health Insurance Card from the Spanish health insurance authorities but
with duration of only for 3 months. This was not convenient since she wanted to
stay in Finland for a longer period. Moreover, Spanish pensioners received the
same card with a validity of 2 to 4 years. SOLVIT Spain contacted the relevant
authority about this discriminatory treatment and persuaded them introduce the
same rule for both Spanish and other EU pensioners. As a result all applicants
now receive the health insurance card with duration of one year.
<br><br><b>Solved within one day.</b><br><br><br><b><i>Finnish dental
practitioner can take up job in Spain thanks to SOLVIT</i></b><br><b>  </b><br>A
Finnish citizen had applied for professional recognition as a dental
practitioner in Spain. She did not receive a reply for many months and finally
she contacted SOLVIT for help. SOLVIT Spain found out that there had been a
misunderstanding about the procedure to be followed and they succeeded in
speeding up the decision of the ministry so that the Finnish dental practitioner
could start working in Spain. <br><br><b>Solved within one
day.</b><br><br><br><br><b>FR – FRANCE</b><br><br><b><i>SOLVIT Netherlands
helps French citizen obtain car tax reimbursement</i></b><br><b> </b><br>A
French citizen bought a new car in France where he also registered it and paid
VAT. He then moved to the Netherlands with his car and registered it in his new
place of residence. Dutch authorities asked him to pay the Dutch VAT and advised
him to ask French authorities for the reimbursement of the French VAT. This
request was contrary to EU law, since a change of residence does not justify the
levying of a VAT. After the intervention of the Dutch SOLVIT centre, the Dutch
competent authorities announced that they will reimburse the amount of VAT paid
in the Netherlands to the client. <br><br><b>Solved within 7
weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>French citizen receives social security benefits in
the Netherlands</i></b><br><br>A French citizen married to a Dutchman moved to
the Netherlands where she wished to request unemployment benefits. In order to
get these benefits, the French authorities needed to grant her specific form
that would enable her to keep her rights while moving to the Netherlands. The
French competent authority initially refused to deliver the document –
contrary to what is foreseen by EU law on coordination of social security
rights. Thanks to the intervention of SOLVIT, that authority finally agreed to
send the form, ensuring her social security and unemployment benefits throughout
the EU. <br><br><b>Solved within 2 weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><br><b>HU -
HUNGARY</b><br><br><b><i>SOLVIT Ireland helps Hungarian doctor get his diploma
recognised </i></b><br><br>A Hungarian doctor requested recognition of his
medical diploma in Ireland. The Irish Medical Council refused the request,
requiring further documents. While the doctor had received his diploma in 1985
before the date of required recognition of EU diplomas, he could prove that he
had effectively and lawfully been exercising his profession for at least the
required minimum period. EU directives state that his working experience should
suffice for recognition of his qualifications. After the Irish SOLVIT Centre
contacted the Irish Medical Council, the Hungarian doctor was granted full
registration. <br><br><b>Solved within 3 weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>French sick
leave paid to Hungarian sailor</i></b><br><br>A Hungarian sailor had been
working in France for one month when he became ill. After completing what he
thought to be the necessary sickness leave forms, French authorities refused him
his sick-leave payment. Unable to further advance in the matter, he contacted
SOLVIT. After investigating the case and communicating with the proper French
authorities, SOLVIT identified the missing forms, enabling the sailor to obtain
his sick-leave payments. <br><br><b>Solved within 4
weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><b>IE – IRELAND</b><br><br><b><i>Irish mortgages
meet French taxes</i></b><br><br>An Irish woman wished to invest in property in
France for which she wanted to take out a mortgage with an Irish mortgage
provider. The French Finance Ministry informed her that the mortgage interest on
the rental income would not be treated as deductible when assessing liability to
income tax in France. However, if she were to take out a mortgage with a French
mortgage agent, the mortgage interest on the rental income would be treated as
deductible.<br>After investigating the case, SOLVIT found that revenues deriving
from French sources should be determined in equal terms whether the owner does
or does not have his/her fiscal residence in France. As there should be no
condition tied to nationality or quality of the loaner, the interests of the
debts constricted by a non-residing taxpayer to an Irish establishment for the
conservation, acquisition, repairing or the improvement of a property are
admitted to tax inference; SOLVIT determined there should be no problem for the
Irish woman's Irish mortgage payment interests to be tax deductible in France.
<br><br><b>Solved within 8 weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>SOLVIT defends the rights
of Irish citizens' spouses </i></b><br><br>While flying between St. Petersburg
and Ireland, an Irish citizen and his Russian spouse had a two-hour stopover in
a Prague airport. Bad weather delayed their arrival in Prague, causing them to
miss their connecting flight home to Ireland. Czech immigration authorities
refused the Irish citizen's non-EU spouse her transit visa, despite the
presentation of both passports, the Russian wife's Irish Immigration card, and
her third country national visa stating that she is the legitimate Spouse of an
Irish Citizen. They were forced to spend the night in the airport. After being
contacted by SOLVIT, the Czech Ministry of Interior admitted that refusal to
issue the visa to the client was not consistent with Czech legislation or
appropriate procedures, and that it should not happen again. The approach of the
Czech custom official was purely an individual failure and was not a consequence
of structural problems concerning domestic legislation or the application of
appropriate regulations. The couple accepted the apology presented by the
Ministry. <br><br><b>Solved within 3 weeks.</b> <br><br><br><br><b>IS –
ICELAND</b><br><br><b><i>Icelandic citizen residing in Austria can still use his
driver's license </i></b><br><br>An Icelandic citizen residing in Austria had a
valid Icelandic driving licence. Austrian authorities informed him that, as he
had been residing in Austria for more than six months, his Icelandic driving
licence had automatically expired and he would consequently have to request a
new Austrian driving licence. After the intervention of the Austrian
SOLVIT-centre, it was clarified that the EU-rules on the mutual recognition of
driving licences had been incorporated into the EEA agreement, obliging Austrian
authorities to acknowledge the Icelandic driving licence. <br><br><b>Solution
found within 5 weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>Icelandic doctor can start work in
the United Kingdom </i></b><br><br>An Icelandic doctor had spent his
professional career working in Sweden, Norway and Iceland. This doctor was
offered a job in the UK. Before taking up the job, he needed to have his
professional qualifications recognised by the General Medical Council (GMC) of
the UK. Despite his professional experience in several Member States, the GMC
refused to recognise his qualifications. SOLVIT intervened to point out to UK
authorities that the refusal was contrary to EU legislation. The General Medical
Council acknowledged the mistake and agreed to recognise the qualifications.

ITALY</b><br></p>
<p><b><i>Italian diploma recognised in Portugal</i></b></p>
<p>An Italian social worker who previously worked in youth development
programmes in Portugal moved to Portugal volunteer in a cultural centre
promoting social integration, citizenship formation and multicultural activities
and exchanges. Soon afterwards she was offered a paid professional traineeship
at the centre as Manager of European Projects for Youngsters promoting European
interchanges and multilingual intercultural activities. In order to begin her
professional traineeship, she was requested to provide a Portuguese approval
document of her Italian diploma. Getting her diploma recognised proved to be a
lengthy and costly process, prompting her to contact SOLVIT. SOLVIT made use of
its contacts in NARIC, a network which facilitates the integration of EU
education systems, and obtained a formal declaration stating the validity of the
Italian diploma. This declaration was accepted, enabling her to begin work at
the cultural association immediately. </p>
<p><b>Solved within 2 weeks. </b> <br><br><br><b><i>SOLVIT helps Italian citizen
to get car tax exemption in Portugal </i></b><br><br>An Italian couple took up
residence in Portugal and left their classic car in Italy with their sons. After
three years they decided to bring the car to Portugal for their own use. The car
was impounded by the Portuguese authorities because it had not been registered
in Portugal and the 30% registration tax had not been paid. While Portuguese law
foresees a period of six months for registering a car imported from another EU
country, the authorities counted this period from the date of formal residence
of the couple in Portugal, not the actual date of transfer of the car from Italy
to Portugal several years later. As a result, the couple had to pay a 9.800 EUR
tax plus fine for a 20-year-old car with a value of 1.000 EUR. After the
intervention of SOLVIT Portugal, the authorities accepted to take the age of the
car into account and exempted the Italian couple from paying the tax.

LITHUANIA</b><br><br><b><i>Lithuanian daughter travels to Austria with Russian
mother</i></b><br><br>A Lithuanian national and her Russian mother, both legally
recognised residents of Lithuania, wished to travel to Austria together. The
Austrian Embassy in Vilnius requested the mother to present a visa application
and various additional documents concerning her living place in Austria,
invitation to Austria, financial documents, health insurance, etc. Sensing an
unnecessary lengthy treatment of the visa process, SOLVIT Austria requested a
facilitated visa procedure which was granted after certain conditions regarding
the process were clarified between both parties. <br><br><b>Solved within 3

get entry visa</i></b><br><br>Finnish authorities refused to issue an entry-visa
to a Nigerian woman married to a Lithuanian national residing in Finland,
claiming that "documents justifying the purpose and conditions of intended stay,
or the contents of these documents, are defective or unclear." SOLVIT Finland
informed Finnish authorities that according to EU regulations on the granting of
visas for spouses of EU nationals, Finnish authorities were infringing upon
articles of the EC directive by refusing the visa. Finnish authorities
recognised their mistake and granted the visa. <br><br><b>Solved within 8

benefits for Austrian citizen</i></b><br><br>After having worked in Austria for
13 years, an Austrian citizen left her job to move to France with her French
fiancé. In France she experienced great difficulties applying for
unemployment benefits. Despite repeatedly providing the proper documents, she
was repeatedly rejected and told to provide other documents than formerly
requested. SOLVIT France contacted French authorities in order to explain to
them that the plaintiff had not been properly advised and therefore hindered
from receiving unemployment benefits. The unacceptable manner in which she had
been repeatedly misinformed was finally recognised by French authorities, who
granted her unemployment benefits from the moment of SOLVIT's intervention
onward. <br><br><b>Solved within 10 weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>SOLVIT helps
Dutchman collect full pension rights</i></b><br><br>A 65-year-old Dutch national
with extended working experience in The Netherlands, Spain and France faced some
obstacles trying to collect his pension. Spain denied him his pension for the 16
years he worked there because he allegedly had not contributed to any EU
country's social security funding at least two years in the last 15 years before
retiring.  Further investigation revealed that Dutch authorities had not
provided Spain with the proper proof of the retiree's contribution to the Dutch
social security system until his last working year. SOLVIT persuaded Dutch
authorities to send the correct forms to Spain, enabling the retiree to collect
his rightful pension. <br><br><b>Solved within 3 days.</b><br><br><br><br><b>LV

sailor lost his eyesight, rendering him incapable to work any longer. The sailor
applied for disability benefits from Latvia, his place of residence, but was
told to apply directly to the Danish competent authority, who did not respond to
his plea. SOLVIT established that, according to EU regulation, the institution
of the place of residence (Latvia) is responsible to accept and process the
application for the disability pension. Furthermore, EU law states that the
client is entitled to receive pension from Denmark.  As a result of SOLVIT's
investigation, the application was re-submitted, accepted, forwarded to the Unit
of International Affairs, and then sent to the competent Danish institutions for
pension processing.  <br><br><b>Solved within 1

Latvian nurse living in Latvia for 26 years recently moved to Malta after
marrying a Maltese national.  Her diploma as a registered nurse was not
recognised as valid for work due to alleged discrepancies in her certificate and

red tape for Maltese mediator</i></b><br><br>A Maltese citizen living in Italy
wished to be registered as a "mediation agent" (Agente di Affari e Mediazione).
The competent authority experienced difficulties determining whether he had the
necessary qualifications for this activity. The administrative procedure was
taking more than a year and prevented the Maltese agent from setting up his
business. In one month, the Italian SOLVIT centre clarified the situation with
the Italian authorities, facilitating the agent's enrolment in the register of

quenches Maltese thirst for Norwegian water</i></b><br><br>A Norwegian company
exporting spring water was perplexed when asked to provide proof of its
conformity to EU trade and health standards by Maltese customs authorities. 
Since the company was already exporting its spring water to various EU member
states, SOLVIT clarified the superfluity of such proof within EU regulations,
giving the Norwegian spring water free flow into Malta's market.

NETHERLANDS</b><br><br><b><i>Dutch company's work recognised across the
EU</i></b><br><br>SOLVIT was contacted by an authorized independent Dutch
company responsible for analysing precious metals and marking their presence in
certain goods. According to Dutch legislation, the company fulfilled all
relevant criteria necessary for their operations, resulting in their enjoyment
of recognition throughout the EU. Their cost-efficient plans to partially
outsource certain tasks to China nonetheless led Czech authorities to warn that
they would withdraw their former observation of mutual recognition. Czech
authorities were concerned that the quality of the company's inspections could
suffer as a result of their partial outsourcing. Seeing as only the marking, not
the laboratory work, was scheduled for outsourcing, Dutch authorities did not
see a reason to withdraw the company's operational licence, deeming the Czech
reaction contrary to EC legislation on mutual recognition. After it was
guaranteed that the company would agree to transparency in its overseas
procedures, the precious metals bearing the marking of the Dutch company were
recognised in the Czech Republic once again. <br><br><b>Solved within two

husband intended to apply for maternity benefits in Spain, but was told that her
application could not be considered as she had not paid social contributions in
Spain for at least 6 months prior to her request. Seeing as she had paid all
necessary social contributions in the Netherlands for over three years before
moving to Spain, SOLVIT argued that she should have the right to Spain's
maternity benefits. SOLVIT's intervention clarified the situation to the
relevant authorities, who invited her to reapply for her benefits using the

NORWAY</b><br><br><b><i>Norwegian citizen receives Czech driving licence
recognition</i></b><br><br>A Norwegian citizen living in the Czech Republic was
refused recognition of his Norwegian driving licence under the justification
that Norway is not a member of the European Union. After the intervention of
SOLVIT the responsible Czech authority admitted that the current Czech
legislation providing the recognition of driving licences from EU citizens also
included citizens from EEA/EFTA countries. <br><br><b>Solved within 4
weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><b><i>Vann, Vand, Vatten – It's all water after
all</i></b><br><br>The Swedish daughter of a Norwegian company importing Danish
and Norwegian food into Sweden was reprimanded in the municipality of
Strömstad for labelling its products with the Danish and Norwegian words
for "water" rather than the Swedish word.  EU regulation states the labelling
should be understood by the consumer, while Swedish regulation states that
although product labelling should be in Swedish, another language is acceptable
provided the spelling is such that the consumer can identify the product without
difficulty.  The company felt that, given the commonality of the word, the close
proximity of Strömstad to Norway, and the general familiarity of
Scandinavians with the three languages across their common borders, it should
not be forced to change their labels for such a minor detail.  When approached
by SOLVIT, the municipality agreed to lift the barrier. <br><br><b>Solved within
5 days.</b><br><br><br><br><b>PL – POLAND</b><br><br><b><i>SOLVIT Poland
solves a car registration problem</i></b><br><br>A Polish citizen purchased a
second hand car in Belgium. The car was delivered with incomplete registration
documents (Part I and a statement from the Belgian police that Part II had been
previously lost). In order to register the car in Poland, Polish competent
authorities requested the applicant to provide an official confirmation that the
vehicle had been previously registered in Belgium. However, the competent
registration office in Belgium refused to issue such confirmation on a request
of a private person, maintaining that such a request had to be made directly by
Polish authorities. Polish authorities refused to make such a request, as
according to Polish traffic law, the applicant himself should present all the
necessary documents. As a result, the applicant couldn’t register the car.
Thanks to intervention of SOLVIT Poland and Polish transportation authorities,
it was found that the Polish traffic law was not in line with the EC directive
in cases where the registration documents had been stolen or lost. Polish
transportation authorities adopted amendments to the regulation which clearly
state that when registration documents have been lost or stolen, Polish
authorities will directly request the necessary documents to the authorities of
another EU country. Furthermore, a specific e-form of enquiry in English is now
available for this purpose. <br><br><b>Solved within 3
weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>SOLVIT Germany helps Polish entrepreneur register
his business in Germany </i></b><br><br>A Polish citizen wanted to set up a
company in Germany, but was refused by the competent German authority on the
argument that the entrepreneur did not speak German. In view of the company he
wanted to establish this requirement was considered disproportionate and
therefore a restriction of the freedom of establishment. As a result of
intervention of SOLVIT Germany, the German competent authority resigned from the
language requirement and promised to admit the Polish enterprise.

PORTUGAL</b><br><br><b><i>SOLVIT Belgium helps Portuguese citizen with
registration at the Belgian unemployment service</i></b><br><br>An unemployed
Portuguese citizen moved to Belgium to look for a job but her request for
registration was rejected by Belgian unemployment services because she did not
have a residence permit. However, such a permit is not necessary for the first
three months of an EU citizen's stay in another Member State during which they
may look for a job. SOLVIT Belgium persuaded the unemployment service to
register the Portuguese citizen so that she could benefit from a language course
and assistance in looking for work. <br><br><b>Solved within one
day.</b><br><br><br><b><i>SOLVIT UK helps Portuguese citizen get his taxes
reimbursed</i></b><br><br>After working in Northern Ireland for over three
years, a Portuguese national returned to Portugal. He was informed that he could
obtain a tax reimbursement for which he filled in the necessary forms and
submitted a declaration from one of his previous employers. For a second
employer he could not submit such a declaration because the company no longer
existed. Nine months later he had still not received the reimbursement. After
the intervention of SOLVIT UK, the Inland Revenue service sent him a cheque for
£520.44 and wrote him a letter of apology explaining the cause for the
delay. <br><br><b>Solved within 7 weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><b>RO –
ROMANIA</b><br><br><b><i>Romanian woman obtains EU work permit in
Spain</i></b><br><br>A Romanian national and legal resident of Spain before
Romania's accession to the EU contacted SOLVIT regarding his Romanian wife. She
had also been a legal resident of Spain before Romania's accession, but did not
possess a work permit. When she asked for an EU citizen residence card with free
access to the labour market, her request was denied for unknown reasons. After
SOLVIT's intervention, Spanish authorities recognised the case as a breach of
the Treaty concerning the accession of the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania to
the European Union. The applicant's spouse was invited to reapply for the
permit, this time with a positive outcome. <br><br><b>Solved within 3
weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>Unjustified Austrian treatment of Romanian bus
driver under Spanish contract corrected</i></b><br><br>A Spanish bus company
legally employing several Romanian drivers maintains a regular passenger
transport service between Spain and Romania.  During a border check of one of
the busses at the Hungarian-Austrian border, the Austrian border police
prevented the bus from passing through Austria as the Romanian driver could not
provide proof of residence in Spain. The driver was unrightfully issued a ban on
driving busses in Austria for the next five years. Moreover, the bus was forced
to detour through Slovenia, to the serious inconvenience of the passengers,
drivers and the bus company.  SOLVIT Spain submitted the case to SOLVIT Austria,
arguing that the Austrian police was not entitled to impose nationality or
residence requirements, let alone prevent the bus from crossing Austria.  SOLVIT
Austria managed to convince the authorities that the police had made a serious
mistake.  Austrian authorities offered their apologies for the inconveniences
caused, lifted the ban on the Romanian driver, and clarified their regulations
to prevent similar mistakes from happening in the future. <br><br><b>Solved

UK helps Swedish citizen to obtain her unemployment benefit </i></b><br><br>A
Swedish citizen applied for unemployment benefits in the UK in accordance with
EU rules. The UK authorities took such a long time, that when they finally
granted the benefit, the Swedish citizen had already returned to Sweden in order
not to lose her Swedish unemployment benefit. The UK authorities then sent
cheques to her previous English address while she was already in Sweden. When
she mandated a friend to cash them in England this was refused by the post
office and the cheques were blocked. Furthermore, the Swedish citizen tried in
vain to obtain the necessary papers signed by the UK unemployment authorities to
be presented to Swedish authorities. The UK SOLVIT centre contacted the
authorities and the applicant received both the money and the missing form in
Sweden. <br><br><b>Solved within 8 weeks.</b><br><br><br><b>S<i>OLVIT helps
Swedish widow to obtain survivor’s pension in
Greece</i></b><br><br>Administrative obstacles in Greece prevented a Swedish
citizen for several years from obtaining the survivor’s pension to which
she was entitled after the death of her Greek husband. The Greek authorities did
not accept the marriage certificate as valid proof and required that the
marriage should be registered in Athens by the Swedish widow in person. SOLVIT
Greece helped her to resolve all formalities so that she could receive her
pension. <br><br><b>Case solved within 10 weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><b>SI

child</i></b><br><br>The child of a Belgian citizen was born in Slovenia with a
double nationality. The parents contacted SOLVIT when the surname of the father
and consequently the name of the child was refused by the Slovene municipality
for legislative reasons: at the time, the relevant Slovene legislation would not
allow citizens to choose personal names with more than two words for either
first or last names. In March 2006, a new law was adopted that gave a legal
basis to change the name in a manner that allowed three words in the last name.
The applicant filed a formal request for a name change for the child which was
granted and entered into the register in Slovenia by May 2006.
<br><br><b>Solution found within 12 weeks.</b><br><br><br><b><i>SOLVIT helps
Italian entrepreneur establish a company in Slovenia</i></b><br><br>An Italian
entrepreneur wishing to establish a company as a self-employed person in
Slovenia waited for three months with no answer to his residence permit requests
from Slovenian authorities. SOLVIT Slovenia investigated the case and found out
that a lack of language understanding was responsible for the confusion about
which documents were necessary for registration. SOLVIT relayed to the Italian
entrepreneur that a proof of registration as self-employed person and a proof of
health insurance would help him obtain his residence permit. With help of SOLVIT
he finally sent all documents requested and got the residence permit, allowing
him to register his own company. <br><br><b>Solved within 3

nurse continues nursing her German patients thanks to SOLVIT</i></b><br><br>A
Slovakian nurse wished to have her professional qualifications recognised in
Germany.  German authorities informed her that she had to pass an examination
because her professional qualification did not meet the minimal requirements
according to EC-law. Only 1 1/2 year after her application, the authority told
the nurse that she might be entitled to obtain automatic recognition on the
basis of acquired rights. German authorities requested therefore a certificate
stating that she had three years -out of the last five years- of continuous
practice in Slovakia. Unfortunately, since she had been working in Germany for
the last two-and-a-half years, she could not fulfil that condition at that time.
SOLVIT argued that, if the German authority had given the correct information
timely, the Slovakian nurse would have been able to submit the requested
certificate. SOLVIT persuaded the authority to accept an explanatory letter from
the Slovakian Ministry of Health stating the nurse's 9-year working experience
in Slovakia. In this way, the nurse could apply for the automatic recognition of
her qualifications. <br><br><b>Solved within 4
weeks.</b><br><br><br><br><b><i>German car registered in
Slovakia</i></b><br><br>A Slovakian citizen contacted SOLVIT after experiencing
troubles registering his German car in Slovakia. The Slovakian authority denied
the client's application because the car allegedly did not fulfil Slovak
conditions concerning the permissible sound level, the braking devices, air
pollution by gases from positive-ignition engines and the electromagnetic
compatibility. However, the authorised importer confirmed that the client's car
fulfilled all conditions set by the EC directives related to the aforementioned
matters. SOLVIT confirmed that the Slovakian authority was handling contrary to
EU law by inhibiting the client from taking advantage of the free movement of
goods within Europe. After a further registration request, the client was
transferred to the proper authority who could finally register his car.

Germany</i></b><br><br> A British hairdresser with over 10 years of experience
running a salon in the United Kingdom wanted to open a similar business in
Germany.  The German authorities rejected his application for a permit because
his certificate of experience had allegedly not been issued by the correct UK
authority.  SOLVIT Germany intervened to argue that, in accordance with EU
rules, the Chamber of Commerce had to accept the certificate.  As a result, the
hairdresser received his permit to start a business. <br><br><b>Solved within 1

expand its market in France. The company was marketing its product
in the UK and a number of Member States and thus conformed to EU rules.
However, French authorities refused to accept the product on its market and
requested additional testing. For over a year, the company tried to
have their product accepted and finally asked SOLVIT UK for help. The
UK company and SOLVIT UK worked closely together to successfully market the
product in France in a matter of weeks. According to the company, SOLVIT helped
them prevent a considerable loss. <br></p>
