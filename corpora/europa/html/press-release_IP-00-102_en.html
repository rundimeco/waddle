<P>Brussels, 2 February 2000 
<H3>
<P><B>Commission approves settlement between Elf Aquitaine and German authorities in the Leuna case </B><B> Decision regarding initial State aid still suspended.</B></H3>
<P><I><B>While it continues its main investigation whether the French oil company Elf received more aid than it was entitled to for the construction of the Leuna 2000 refinery, the European Commission has decided to conditionally approve a settlement agreement (</B></I><I><B>"Vergleichsvereinbarung</B></I><I><B>") concluded between the Bundesanstalt f</B></I><I><B>ür vereinigungsbedingte Sonderaufgaben (BvS), the Regional Government of  Saxony-Anhalt and the Elf. Therein, the German authorities recognise a DM 360 million claim by Elf. The Commission found that two thirds of this amount do not constitute aid and can be paid out immediately. For the remaining DM 120 million, the Commission concluded that they are State aid which is compatible with the common market. The Commission, however, could accept the settlement as a whole only after the German authorities</B></I><I><B>' commitment that the sum of DM 120 million will be paid to a blocked account and remain blocked until the Commission has taken a final decision regarding the justification of the State aid Elf had received for the construction of the Leuna refinery.</B></I>
<P>Within the settlement agreement, BvS and Elf waive mutually all their claims which had emerged during the privatisation and reconstruction of the Leuna refinery situated in Eastern Germany. Under the agreement, Elf will receive a lump sum of DM 360 million as  compensation for various claims. Out of this sum, DM 240 million will be paid by BvS. The remaining DM 120 million will be paid by the Region of Saxony-Anhalt as a partial compensation for the non-receipt of an Investment Grant of DM 360 million on which Elf had lost its original claim due to a negative Commission decision of 1997 regarding the scheme ("Investitionszulagengesetz") on which the claim was based. 
<P>The BvS contribution should, in particular, compensate a claim that had emerged from the breach of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) concluded between it and Elf in 1994. In this MoU, BvS undertook on behalf of its at that time 100% owned chemical complex "Buna" to grant  Elf a 33% put option on the shares of the refinery once the refinery would be operational. At the same time Buna would have the right to acquire up to 33% of the shares of Elf Oil AG (the Minol petrol stations which Elf had also taken over). 
<P>In 1995 however, 100% of the Buna shares were sold to the American chemical producer Dow without the put option being incorporated into the sales contract. Elf therefore brought the German authorities to court and requested to stop the Buna privatisation unless the put- option would be included into the Buna privatisation contract. The German Court ruled that the German authorities were not hindered by law from privatising Buna without the put- option. The Court concluded, however, that the German authorities had breached their obligations towards Elf stemming from the MoU. Therefore, the German authorities were obliged to compensate Elf for the non-fullfillment of the MoU. No reference, however, was made to the amount of compensation.
<P>In order to avoid further Court proceeding, BvS and Elf then concluded the settlement agreement by which they clarified their legal positions about the breach of the MoU. As a result, it was agreed that Elf would receive DM 360 million as settlement amount. 
<P>However, in the settlement submitted to the Commission, no reference was made to the value of the different liabilities. Thus, it was difficult to recognise how the different claims were calculated and to examine whether, with the settlement, really existing legal claims up to the amounts alleged by the German authorities were waived or whether it rather meant a disguised compensation of the forgone DM 360 million investment grant on which Elf had, following the Commission's decision of 1997, lost its claim. In the latter case, the settlement would clearly have to be considered as a DM 360 Million aid.
<P>While notifying the settlement the German authorities alleged that there was no aid element involved since the total of the claims which Elf had against them could have reached up to DM 700 million (the DM 360 million under the "Investitionszulagengesetz" not included). Thus, accepting a payment of DM 360 million without awaiting a decision by a Court would have been a good deal for the German authorities.
<P>In the follow-up period, the Commission verified that BvS indeed could have been faced with claims totalling up to DM 700 million if Elf had brought them to Court. Since BvS was not willing to pay more than DM 240 million and since Elf, on the other side, considered DM 360 million the absolute minimum amount for which it would settle, the Land of Saxony-Anhalt, which was not a party within the dispute of legal claims but which wanted to maintain good relations with Elf, proved willing to contribute another DM 120 million. 
<P>The Commission examined the settlement agreement on the basis of the private investor test and arrived at the conclusion that the DM 240 million payment by BvS does not constitute State aid since legal claims between BvS and Elf actually existed, the value of these claims actually could achieve the maximum indicated by the German authorities, the agreement concluded was well within the limits of the sums being under dispute and there were reasonable justifications for the agreement achieved. 
<P>Such a conclusion, however, could not be reached as regards the DM 120 million payment by Saxony-Anhalt since it was not a party to the dispute between Elf and BvS and Elf had no legal claims against Saxony-Anhalt as it had against BvS. Thus, this contribution had to be qualified as aid.
<P>This, however, did not mean that this sum was automatically incompatible with EU state aid rules. To the contrary, when the Commission rejected the "Investitionszulage" in 1997, it  explicitly left the door open for an ad hoc compensatory aid. In addition, in 1993, the Commission had already approved such aid, which even exceeded the current amount in question, as being compatible with the EC-Treaty. With these past decisions, the Commission had created legitimate expectations. In addition, the overall aid ceiling for new investments in Eastern Germany (35 % of  investment costs) would not be exceeded by the DM 120 million. Therefore, the settlement agreement, including the state aid element, could be approved.
<P>While approving the settlement, the Commission had well in mind that it did not yet adopt a final decision regarding its separate State aid investigation on allegedly inflated investment costs for the construction of the "Leuna 2000" refinery. Because of the ongoing public prosecutors' investigations in Germany and France it is, at this stage, not be in a position to adopt a decision on this issue. Following the EU Court of Justice's jurisprudence, compatible aid cannot be paid to a firm as long as this firm has not reimbursed incompatible aid; the Commission therefore could only accept the settlement agreement after the German authorities' commitment that the DM 120 million will not be paid directly to the beneficiary but to a blocked account and remain blocked until a final decision in the refinery cost case has been taken.
