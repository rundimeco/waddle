<p>2008 jet crash blamed on turbine blade</p>
<p>An investigation into the April 2008 crash of a training jet near Moose Jaw has concluded a cracked turbine blade in its engine brought down the jet.</p>
<p>Two airmen successfully bailed out of the Britishbuilt CT-156 Hawk jet, but were seriously injured.</p>
<p>At the time, they were identified as Lt. Rock Veilleux of the Canadian Forces and Maj. Frank Wegener of the German Air Force, who was flying the aircraft.</p>
<p>A report released Wednesday by the air force's Directorate of Flight Safety said they noticed a change in the engine sound, then a warning light.</p>
<p>Declaring an emergency, they prepared for a forced landing, but had to eject a mile short of the runway. The aircraft was destroyed in the resulting crash inside the base's perimeter.</p>
<p>The investigation indicated fatigue caused a low-pressure turbine blade to crack, then fail. The engine vibrated so badly that it seized.</p>
<p>An investigation to determine the cause of the fatigue is ongoing, the report said.</p>
<p>A report into a 2001 Hawk crash at Cold Lake also noted a missing low-pressure turbine blade from the engine, "which is similar to LPT blade failures in four previous CF Hawk aircraft occurrences."</p>
