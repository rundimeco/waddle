<p>The hospital cured his pneumonia, but the bill — for an eye-popping $44 million — made him sick.</p>
<p>Unemployed doorman Alexis Rodriguez couldn’t believe his eyes when he opened an envelope from Bronx-Lebanon Hospital last week and saw what he appeared to owe.</p>
<p>“I almost had an asthma attack,” said Rodriguez, 28, just one of several hundred patients to receive absurdly inflated bills because of a “system error.”</p>
<p>His amount due was $44,776,587 for outpatient services that in reality amounted to no more than $300.</p>
<p>Initially, Rodriguez panicked because he had spent three weeks in the hospital with pneumonia in the spring and knew he had to pay part of the $40,000 cost.</p>
<p>But he quickly realized the terrifying invoice couldn’t be right. He called the billing company and found out he wasn’t the only one with sticker shock.</p>
<p>The billing firm, PHY Services, said it was a simple mistake: The subcontractor that prints the bills put the invoice number into the “amount due” field.</p>
<p>“We are sending an apology letter to everyone who received it,” said PHY Services rep Ricardo Paul.</p>
<p>The company has apparently been deluged with complaints. A recording for callers says:</p>
<p>“If you are calling with respect to a billing statement for services provided at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, please disregard the statement</p>
<p>. You will be receiving a new statement shortly. “</p>
<p>Rodriguez said that even though no harm was done to his bottom line, the sloppiness surprised him.</p>
<p>“It was a big error,” he said.</p>
<p>“I think they should have somebody look over the bills before they send them out.</p>
<p>“I understand manpower may be down, but to send out a lot of bills with numbers that big — someone could have had a heart attack.”</p>
<p>Hospital spokesman Errol Schneer said he didn’t blame Rodriguez for being upset.</p>
<p>“We certainly share any concerns he would have,” he said.</p>
