<p>The cosmetic surgery boss who is demanding the taxpayer pay to replace faulty breast implants was appointed by the last Labour government to advise on patient safety and regulation of private firms.</p>
<p>Mel Braham, chairman of Harley Medical Group (HMG), was asked to join a Department of Health steering committee that supported the then-chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson in tackling misleading advertising and increasing regulation of Botox injections.</p>
<p>The committee met nine times during 2005 and 2006 and planned to introduce tougher penalties for rogue plastic surgeons and an academy to accredit and train cosmetic doctors.</p>
<p>'Profit motives': Mel Braham</p>
<p>This week, Mr Braham, 70, was accused of failing the 13,900 women his company fitted with PiP (Poly Implant Prosthesis) implants by claiming that removing them would put hmg out of business.</p>

<p>Braham, a multi-millionaire who made his fortune in macadamia nuts and hair transplants in Australia, lives in a £1.6 million London apartment.</p>
<p>HMG is owned by a financial trust, Praxis, based in Guernsey.</p>
<p>Records show Praxis owned all of the shares, which has tax advantages. Its relationship with HMG is unknown, but Praxis is not involved in the day-to-day running of the company.</p>
<p>Tory MP Dr Daniel Poulter, who sits on the Health Select Committee, said: ‘It is unacceptable for cosmetic surgery companies to put profit motives before the best interests of patients.’ HMG says the responsibility lies with the Government.</p>
<p>Praxis Group did not return calls for comment. A spokesman for Mr Braham said: ‘We are unable to comment further as this information is with HMG’s lawyers.’</p>
<p>'Scapegoat': The Harley Medical Group, claims it is the victim of a conspiracy by surgeons who want to see it out of business</p>
<p>Mr Braham wants the taxpayer to foot the bill to help its patients.</p>
<p>The multi-million-pound cosmetic surgery business, which fitted more PIP implants than any other British firm, also claimed it will need a Government loan if it is to help the NHS.</p>
<p>Mr Braham said his firm had been made a ‘scapegoat’ in the saga and was the victim of a conspiracy by other surgeons who want to see him out of business.</p>
<p>The chain is currently deluged with around 2,000 calls a day from women, most of whom want their implants removed.</p>
<p>The group, which had a turnover of more than £30million in 2009, fitted around one in three of the 45,000 PIP implants sold across the country.</p>
<p>Mr Braham said the business did not have the money, time or space to remove and replace all the implants – and the NHS should step in.</p>
<p>Booming business: The group fitted PIP implants in 13,900 women between September 2001 and 2010</p>
<p>He said the chain of 31 clinics, like its patients, was an ‘innocent victim’ of a regulatory failure, and said it was ‘outrageous’ of the Government to call on private clinics to take responsibility.</p>
<p>His comments have caused fury among MPs, patients, surgeons and lawyers, who say a clinic’s first duty is to its patients, not its profits.</p>
<p>They came as Health Secretary Andrew Lansley announced spot checks on plastic surgery clinics and a wide-ranging review of cosmetic surgery practices from nose jobs and laser surgery to injections used to iron out wrinkles.</p>
