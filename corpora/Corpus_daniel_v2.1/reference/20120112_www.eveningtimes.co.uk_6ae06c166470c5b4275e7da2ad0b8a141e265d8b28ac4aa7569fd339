<p>Study could help to cut risks of IVF</p>
<p>A PIONEERING Glasgow study could help more women conceive using IVF and reduce the health risks.</p>
<p>Research has shown that IVF is most effective and safest when no more than two embryos are used – particularly for older women.</p>
<p>Current regulations allow for women over 40 to have three embryos implanted in an IVF treatment cycle.</p>
<p>However, research carried out by the University of Glasgow has shown the chances of success are no greater than for two while the risk of complications is higher.</p>
<p>A major complication of IVF treatment is multiple pregnancy – the birth of twins or triplets – which is associated with higher rates of pre-eclampsia, premature birth and blood loss.</p>
<p>The findings are likely to result in new world-wide guidelines for IVF treatment.</p>
