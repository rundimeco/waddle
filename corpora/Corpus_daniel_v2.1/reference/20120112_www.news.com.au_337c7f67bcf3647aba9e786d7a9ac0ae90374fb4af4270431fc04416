<p>Musician Elton John to write book on global AIDS epidemic</p>
<p>ELTON John is writing his first book, which will ask why more isn't being done to fight the AIDS crisis.</p>
<p>The musician says Love is the Cure: Ending the Global AIDS Epidemic will include memories of friends who died of AIDS-related illnesses, including Queen frontman Freddie Mercury.</p>
<p>British publisher Hodder & Stoughton says the book will be published in July along with an audio book read by the British pop star.</p>
<p>Proceeds will go to the Elton John AIDS Foundation.</p>
<p>John said on Monday the book would ask why more was not being done to cure the disease.</p>
<p>He said AIDS "is a disease that must be cured not by a miraculous vaccine, but by changing hearts and minds, and through a collective effort to break down social barriers".</p>
