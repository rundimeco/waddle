<p>Man in Stable Condition After $44 Million Hospital Bill</p>
<p>ABC News’ Ben Waldron reports:</p>
<p>A Bronx man says he nearly had an asthma attack after opening his mail to find a $44 million medical bill from a local hospital.</p>
<p>Unemployed doorman Alexis Rodriguez, 28, received the astronomical bill after receiving successful treatment for pneumonia at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital last week, The New York Daily News reports.</p>
<p>“I almost had an asthma attack,” said Rodriguez, who apparently is not the only patient to receive an outsized bill. The firm responsible for the botched billing, PHY Services, was reportedly inundated with complaints and has since apologized.</p>
<p>“If you are calling with respect the billing statement for services provided at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, please disregard the statement,” said a recording for concerned callers, “you will be receiving a new statement shortly.”</p>
<p>PHY is blaming the mistake on a “system error” that resulted in the bill’s invoice number being mistakenly placed in the “amount due” field.</p>
<p>As for Rodriguez, he owes no more than $300 for outpatient services.</p>
