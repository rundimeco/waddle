<p>Is the hCG Diet Right for You?</p>
<p>What is hCG Weight Loss Diet?</p>
<p>hCG is a hormone produced by the placenta during pregnancy. During pregnancy, the substance almost completely controls the woman’s metabolic functions. Generally, the hCG used in the diet protocols, is synthetic.</p>
<p>How much weight will I lose with the hCG Weight Loss Diet?</p>
<p>This all natural weight loss program is helping people lose up to a pound per day, with many losing over 30 pounds each month! Factors that guarantee faster weight loss include increasing fresh vegetable intake and keeping hydrated by drinking lots of water.</p>
<p>What preparations are required for hCG Weight Loss shots?</p>
<p>Prior to treatment, our physician will require current CBC, CMP, and TSH blood tests. If you do not have current blood work, our lab accepts most insurance and will provide the series at discounted $60 (includes $10 for the blood draw) for our clients.</p>
<p>Is it healthy to lose 1 to 2 pounds a day with hCG Weight Loss Diet?</p>
<p>hCG Weight Loss Diet studies have shown that weight lost following the Simeons protocol comes directly from adipose fat tissue rather than lean muscle. This means that the weight lost comes directly from fat. The hCG Diet does not strip the body of much needed muscle, vitamins or minerals essential to maintain good health. hCG Weight Loss dieters report a feeling and appearance of great health and marvel at the loss of negative health risks they had as an overweight individual.</p>
<p>Why the 500 calorie diet – VLCD (very low calorie diet )?</p>
<p>hCG Weight Loss Diet shots cause your hypothalamus to mobilize the fat out of the fat storage locations so that it’s available for use. While you are only consuming 500 calories, your hypothalamus is continually releasing the fat stored in your body. Because of this, your body is actually operating on thousands of calories a day. The result is your body using thousands of calories of fat from your body each day, the reason HCG Weight Loss dieters lose 1 to 2 lbs of fat or more, per day.</p>
