<p>Lives of pupils with asthma ‘put at risk by inhaler rules’</p>

<p>THOUSANDS of children with asthma across Scotland face difficulty accessing lifesaving inhalers during emergencies at school due to needless red tape, a health charity said today.</p>
<p>Asthma UK said schools are prevented from keeping a spare inhaler on their premises because they are prescription-only medicines. But this puts children’s lives at risk when they have forgotten their own inhaler or have run out, it said.</p>
<p>The charity is calling for a change in the rules to allow schools to keep inhalers in their first aid kits.</p>
<p>On average, two children in every class in the UK have asthma – meaning there are 72,000 children in Scotland relying on inhalers to keep them well.</p>
<p>Scotland also has one of the highest rates of childhood asthma in the world, although the exact reason for this is unknown. Approximately 100 Scots die from asthma each year, despite the fact that 90 per cent of deaths are thought to be preventable with the right care.</p>
<p>The charity said the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) could provide an exemption to the regulations to allow schools to supply the inhalers.</p>
<p>Similar exemptions already exist for organisations such as the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) and the armed forces.</p>
<p>A survey by the charity of children with asthma from across the UK aged between five and 18 found almost two-thirds have had an asthma attack at school.</p>
<p>One in five children with asthma said they find it “quite difficult” or “very difficult” to access their inhaler at school, and more than half (55 per cent) said they do not always know where their inhaler is or how to get it.</p>
<p>About 64 per cent of children with asthma have at some point been unable to access a working reliever inhaler in school, having either forgotten, lost, broken or run out of their own.</p>
<p>Gordon Brown, national director of Asthma UK Scotland, said: “These medicines are very safe but going without them can be very dangerous, so it is crucial that the MHRA changes the rules and allows schools to keep a spare inhaler as a last resort.</p>
<p>“The majority of children know to find a teacher if they don’t have their own inhaler when having an asthma attack at school, but the reality is there is very little that staff can legally do to help. This puts children at risk.”</p>
<p>A spokesman for the MHRA said: “In the interests of patient safety, asthma inhalers should only be supplied on prescription to the individual named, for his or her own use.</p>
<p>“The MHRA has no plans to change the current legal position.”</p>
