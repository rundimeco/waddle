<p>Province supports program for families affected by Alzheimer's</p>
<p>The province will give $555,000 to the Alzheimer Society of Manitoba (ASM) over the next three years to support the new First Link program that helps families affected by Alzheimer's disease, Premier Greg Selinger said today.</p>
<p>First Link brings services and supports to people affected by Alzheimer's disease or related dementia as soon as possible after diagnosis. Supports include information, support groups, education sessions and referral to other health agencies or resources. While physicians and health-care providers can make referrals to First Link, individuals and their families can also contact ASM directly.</p>
<p>More than 19,000 Manitobans have Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. In 2011 alone, more than 4,300 Manitobans over 65 developed Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia.</p>
