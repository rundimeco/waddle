<p>Antioxidant-rich foods can prevent diabetes and heart disease</p>
<p>People who eat a diet rich in foods containing powerful antioxidants not only lower their risk of developing heart disease but can slash their cholesterol and even get diabetes under control, suggest experts.</p>
<p>The secret lies in a regular dose of potent, health-giving foods rich in antioxidants called flavonoids.</p>
<p>They are found in abundance in plant-based foods, with onions, apples, berries, kale, and broccoli having highest concentrations.</p>
<p>They are also found in high amounts in tea, berries, chocolate and even red wine.</p>
<p>They work by fighting harmful molecules accumulating in the body that damage healthy cells.</p>
<p>A 12-month trial carried out by scientists at the University of East Anglia found that diets high in these flavonoids could reduce the risk of heart disease for women with Type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>The new study also found that regularly eating flavonoid-rich foods could also help in the management of diabetes.</p>
<p>The study looked at 93 postmenopausal women with Type 2 diabetes from the age of 51 to 74. Half were given two small bars of flavonoid-enriched chocolate each day and half were given placebo chocolate bars.</p>
<p>Those receiving extra flavonoids reduced the risk of a heart attack by 3.4 per cent.</p>
<p>Their insulin resistance and cholesterol levels were significantly reduced by the flavonoids.</p>
<p>“These results are significant because they provide further concrete evidence that diet has a beneficial clinical effect over and above conventional drug treatment,” the Daily Express quoted Professor Aedin Cassidy, of Norwich Medical School, as saying.</p>
<p>The researchers say further research is needed to examine if similar effects are seen in men with Type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>The findings have been published in the journal Diabetes Care.</p>
