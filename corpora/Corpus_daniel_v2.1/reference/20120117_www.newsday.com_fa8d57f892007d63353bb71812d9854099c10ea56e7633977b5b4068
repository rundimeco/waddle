<p>Paula Deen says she's got Type 2 diabetes</p>
<p>Celebrity chef and Food Network star Paula Deen announced on the "Today" show Tuesday morning that she was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes three years ago.</p>
<p>Deen said she kept quiet about her condition until she had advice to offer the public. She announced she has teamed up with drugmaker Novo Nordisk to launch a program that aims to help people live with Type 2 diabetes and promote a Novo diabetes drug.</p>
<p>The program is called Diabetes in a New Light and offers tips on food preparation, stress management and working with doctors on a treatment plan. Recipes and tips can be found at http://www.Diabetesinanewlight.com.</p>
<p>"I wanted to bring something to the table when I came forward," she said Tuesday during an appearance on NBC's "Today" show. "I've always been one to think that I bring hope." When asked if the high-fat, high-caloric recipes she champions can lead to diabetes, she hedged.</p>
<p>"That is part of the puzzle," she said, but mentioned other factors: genetics, lifestyle, stress and age.</p>
<p>"On my show I share with you all these yummy, fattening recipes, but I tell people, 'in moderation,"' she added. "I've always eaten in moderation." Deen has Type 2 diabetes and takes Victoza, a once-daily noninsulin injection. The website links to promotional materials for the drug.</p>
<p>Type 2 is the most common form of diabetes. In Type 2 diabetes, the body either does not produce enough insulin or does not use it efficiently, allowing excess sugar, or glucose, to accumulate in the blood.</p>
<p>The 64-year-old Deen, known as "the Queen of Southern cuisine," appears on Food Network.</p>
