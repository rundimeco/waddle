<p>Lessons to be learned from a sorry situation</p>
<p>Should private medical companies replace dangerous breast implants for free? Some private firms have ignored a call for them to take out PIP implants at no charge.</p>
<p>They argue the Government and the medical watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Products Agency are at fault for allowing the cut-price implants to be sold in the UK.</p>
<p>It's not their fault that they used them and they say that replacing them with more expensive implants would financially ruin them.</p>
<p>Are they right to refuse? Well, morally, no. They carried out the work so they should be responsible if it goes wrong later, surely?</p>
<p>Private firms such as Nuffield, Spire Healthcare and BMI have followed the call from Health Secretary Andrew Lansley to replace the implants.</p>
<p>But bosses at the firms that have refused would say they were running a business, not a church. They did not manufacture the implants and they did not pass them as safe to use in surgery.</p>
<p>So should it be left to the NHS to replace them at a cost of tens of millions of pounds to the taxpayer?</p>
<p>Well, as a last resort, it has a duty to.</p>
<p>The Welsh government has said it would pay to remove and replace banned breast implants from women who were treated privately.</p>
<p>Welsh health minister, Lesley Griffiths, said: "Removing the implants and not replacing them could result in unsightly scarring, loose skin, and potentially the accumulation of fluids, need for drainage, and risk of infection."</p>
<p>The NHS will pay to remove, but not replace, implants if a private clinic refuses or no longer exists. Which is not enough.</p>
<p>One estimate claims that about 50,000 implants are involved (some cosmetic, some reconstructive), which could cost the NHS as much as ВЈ150m.</p>
<p>What this whole sorry, scary mess has shown is that there is a shocking lack of governance and regulation on the issue.</p>
<p>There needs to be stricter controls over what can be used in cosmetic and reconstructive surgery.</p>
<p>There has to be clear and cast-iron responsibility for the work carried out.</p>
<p>But also, any woman undertaking a breast implant for whatever reason must be properly informed that they don't last forever, that they will need replacing and that there is always risk of rupture, however slight.</p>
