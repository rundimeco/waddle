<p>X-ray images reveal just how wedged in a $2 coin was.</p>
<p>A 10-year-old boy's trip to the shop ended up with a midnight trip to hospital after he swallowed a $2 coin meant for an icecream.</p>
<p>The Tauranga boy, his brother and sister were on their way to their local shop to buy an icecream about 4pm on Sunday.</p>
<p>The boy's father, radio identity Grayson Ottaway, said his son could not remember what happened next, other than the moment of swallowing the $2 coin.</p>
<p>"It was a bit traumatic for him. We seem to think he was playing around and had it sitting in the side of his mouth, maybe he was tying his shoes laces or something," Mr Ottaway said.</p>
<p>"He seems to remember when he swallowed it, then the instant reaction was that he vomited. It was that gag reflex."</p>
<p>Mr Ottaway's son continued to throw up when he got home, with the gag reflexes out of control.</p>
<p>"He was really violently ill and, of course, his mother was wondering what the hell was going on," he said.</p>
<p>"She was thinking 'maybe it's something he'd eaten'. Then he said 'Mum, what happens if you swallow a bit of metal?"'</p>
<p>The boy was taken to Tauranga Hospital where an X-ray revealed the golden culprit sitting wedged in his oesophagus.</p>
<p>"They looked at the X-ray and saw where it was and said there's no way he's going to be able to cough that up."</p>
<p>Transfer plans were made to take Mr Ottaway's son to Waikato Hospital, where he could be operated on and the coin safely removed. Mr Ottaway said the incident left his son too weak to stand that day but he was grateful it was not in his windpipe.</p>
<p>The boy was given a general anaesthetic about midnight and taken into theatre, where doctors used long medical tongs to retrieve the coin.</p>
<p>"It literally took 15 minutes, if that," Mr Ottaway said.</p>
<p>Yesterday, his son was back to normal and a "chirpy little bugger". "He's absolutely fine now," his father said.</p>
