<p>New fertility clinic opens in Dublin</p>
<p>Hundreds of couples trying for a baby are expected to attend the new clinic</p>
<p>A new private fertility clinic has opened in Ireland which provides a treatment to identify embryos at risk of carrying an inherited disorder, prior to implantation.</p>
<p>Beacon Care Fertility in Sandyford in Dublin has been built at a cost of &#x20AC;2.5 million.</p>
<p>It hopes to treat hundreds of couples, many of whom currently travel to Britain for the treatment called Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD).</p>
<p>The treatment uses specialist probes individually designed for the patient, who may be at risk of passing on a devastating inherited disorder.</p>
<p>Fertility specialist Dr Simon Fishel said that PGD allows the clinic to screen eggs or early placental cells before the embryo goes back in the womb, to see if a genetic condition is being carried.</p>
<p>If this is the case, experts will try to have an embryo free of genetic disease to assist reproduction.</p>
<p>There are around nine assisted human reproduction clinics in Ireland, with most operating in the private sector.</p>
<p>The Beacon Clinic will also provide newer treatments available elsewhere in Ireland which reduce the risk of a further miscarriage and which can provide a better freeze-thaw survival rate for frozen eggs.</p>
<p>Reproductive immunology helps women who miscarry, or do not achieve embryo implantation in the womb, because their immune system rejects it.</p>
<p>Screening for chromosome anomalies is also provided as this is the biggest cause of embryo failure.</p>
<p>New time-lapse imaging technology allows experts to watch the cells of an embryo develop over days and will show if the embryo is not viable, which occurs in around 70% of cases.</p>
<p>Unlike most of Europe, Ireland has no legislation in the area of assisted human reproduction, although there are Medical Council guidelines in place and established clinical practice.</p>
<p>The 2005 Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction report recommended legislation and a body to regulate this complex sector.</p>
<p>No date is yet available from the Government for the publication of promised legislation.</p>
<p>Dr Fishel said there was a degree of regulation in Ireland.</p>
<p>He said that in Britain the area was heavily regulated and it was up to the Government and Irish people to determine how much regulation is needed here.</p>
<p>He said it was important that pregnancy rates issued by clinics were genuine and that they were audited.</p>
