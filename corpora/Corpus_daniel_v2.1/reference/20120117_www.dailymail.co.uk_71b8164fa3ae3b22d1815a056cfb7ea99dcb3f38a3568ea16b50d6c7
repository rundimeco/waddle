<p>Breakthrough in bid to grow blood vessels in the lab which could revolutionise heart attack and stroke treatment</p>
<p>Scientists are a step closer to making ‘off the shelf’ veins and arteries which could revolutionise treatment for heart attacks and strokes.</p>
<p>A team at Cambridge University has managed to grow all three main types of cells which make up the walls of a blood vessel.</p>
<p>They say the breakthrough could help create blood vessels in the laboratory for surgeons simply to implant into patients – as an alternative to heart bypass treatment and stenting.</p>
<p>Treatment breakthrough: Blood vessels created in the laboratory could be useful in treating cardiovascular disease as blood vessels narrow</p>
<p>One in three deaths in Britain is caused by cardiovascular disease, as a result of blood vessels narrowing or becoming blocked by fatty deposits.</p>
<p>Test tube blood vessels could also be used to treat kidney dialysis patients and leg bypasses, and to fix damaged arteries after accidents for those who might otherwise lose a limb.</p>
<p>The researchers used patients’ own skin cells to make different types of vascular smooth muscle cells.</p>
<p>Dr Sanjay Sinha, who worked on the discovery for four years said: ‘This research represents an important step towards being able to generate the right kind of smooth muscle cells to help construct these new blood vessels.</p>
