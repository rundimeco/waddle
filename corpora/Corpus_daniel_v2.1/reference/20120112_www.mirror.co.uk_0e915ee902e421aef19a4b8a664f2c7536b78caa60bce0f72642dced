<p>Lauren was in shock when she realised she was affected</p>
<p>TOWIE star Lauren Pope has revealed that she has the PIP breast implants that have been at the centre of a health scare for the last few weeks. Lauren - who was formerly a glamour model - talks about her concern over the implants in the Tonight show, which is on tomorrow evening.</p>
<p>"The lady that works for my surgeon rang me quite late at night, it was about ten o'clock when I got the call," former glamour model Lauren tells the show. "Her phone number came up on my phone and I thought, 'Oh God, it's not going to be good news'.</p>
<p>"She said, 'Just to let you know, you have got those implants, the English government aren't saying you have to have them out yet, but the French are'. Because I hadn't really paid attention, I didn't know whether it was really bad, and so straight away my gut feeling was like, 'Oh my God, I'm going to have to have another boob job!'"</p>

<p>Understandably Lauren - who used to go out with Celebrity Big Brother's Kirk when they were both starring in TOWIE - said that she was in shock when she fully realised what was going on.</p>
<p>"I just thought like, how the hell has this happened? How can 40,000 women be in the same situation now; where we'll either not have an operation and keep them in us and think it might be fine, it might not Or we have to now go and have another major operation that probably none of us really wanted in the first place."</p>
