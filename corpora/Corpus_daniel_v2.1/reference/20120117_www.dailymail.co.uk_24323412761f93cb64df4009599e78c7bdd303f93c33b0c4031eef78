<p>'Organic' sperm donor who has fathered 14 children admits he is a 36-year-old VIRGIN</p>
<p>He has never had sex, yet fathers 14 children.</p>
<p>Trent Arsenault hit the headlines last December when his free sperm bank came under investigation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which threatened him with a $100,000 fine and up to a year in jail.</p>
<p>Now, the Fremont, California local who bills himself as having an ideal gene pool to father children, has revealed that he is a 36-year-old virgin.</p>
<p>Father of 14: Trent Arsenault is a virgin at 36 yet has fathered an astonishing 14 children by donating his sperm to needy couples</p>
<p>The revelation on Anderson Cooper's daytime show, Anderson, means that the self-confessed tech-geek, an expert in Silicon Valley, finds himself in the highly unusual position of never having had sex, but fathering 14 healthy offspring.</p>
<p>Speaking on the chat show, Mr Arsenault said: 'I coined this term "donor sexual" and I'll explain it means 100 per cent of my sexual energy is for producing sperm for childless couples to have babies. So I don't have other activity outside of that.'</p>

<p>An incredulous Mr Cooper asked: 'So you do not have sex?'</p>
<p>'I will probably be the 40-year-old virgin,' the donor explained. 'Except I'll have 15 plus kids' - a statement that bought with it applause from the audience to the confusion of the host.</p>

<p>The show saw the virgin dad meet one of his progeny for the first time as Analise, who turns two this week, walked onto the stage.</p>
<p>A visibly emotional Mr Arsenault said the meeting was a 'a thrill.' The toddler is mothered by a lesbian couple who seemed overjoyed following the donor's decision to help them conceive.</p>
<p>'I'm trying to not get too emotional,' he said. 'I’m just extremely happy that she's healthy and in a loving home. I hope she has the gene of compassion and that her parents nurture that.'</p>
<p>Thrilled: The donor was visibly moved by meeting one of his offsrping for the first time on the show. He said he hoped she has the gene of compassion</p>
<p>Via a website, he touts his sperm as being organic but a health expert on the show warned that his unusual approach to fatherhood opens the door to spreading viral diseases such as HIV.</p>
<p>Her fears echo those of the FDA which claims Mr Arsenault did not take precautions to prevent disease spreading and found him to be unlawfully manufacturing human cells.</p>
<p>The agency issued a 'cease-and-desist order' in what is the first ever case of its kind involving a private sperm donor in the U.S.</p>
<p>Mr Arsenault said in the past that he is simply helping out childless couples in situation where the only other alternative would be sex with a stranger.</p>
<p>He told Huffington Post: ‘I'm helping people in need... I'm not running a business here.'</p>
