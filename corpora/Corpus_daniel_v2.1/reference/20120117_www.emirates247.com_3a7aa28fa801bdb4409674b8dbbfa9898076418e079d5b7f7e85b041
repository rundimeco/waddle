<p>Patient sent $44.8 million bill by hospital</p>
<p>NEW YORK: One New York resident had his heart in his mouth when he received his hospital bill whopping $44.8 million. This almost made him sick again.</p>
<p>Alexis Rodriguez, 28, had visited Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Cente for pneumonia threatmen. He took the service of outpatient and the bill should have amounted to no more than $300.</p>
<p>Rodriguez is one of the several hundred patients getting billed for tens of millions of dollars because of a computer error at the New York City hospital.</p>
<p>Initially, Rodriguez thought the bill was legitimate. Last spring he had received a large bill when he was hospitalized for pneumonia for three weeks â€” but obviously not a large as this bill.</p>
<p>The error occurred because the company that prepares the bills had mistakenly put the invoice number in the space where the invoice amount should go.</p>
<p>The hospital representative said that an apology letter is being sent to everyone who received such bills.</p>
