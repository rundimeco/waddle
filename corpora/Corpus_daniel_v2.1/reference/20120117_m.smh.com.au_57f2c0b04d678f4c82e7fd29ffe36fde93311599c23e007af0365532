<p>Warning on heart catheter, inquest into baby's death hears</p>

<p>A catheter used on a child at the Royal Children's Hospital in 2008 had carried a warning to doctors to read instructions carefully because, if procedure was not followed properly, the patient could die, the Coroner's Court heard today.</p>
<p>Tama Galiere, 10 months old, was admitted to the hospital on June 21, 2008, with an eye infection and had the catheter inserted into his heart on June 23.</p>
<p>But the child died on June 25 and an autopsy found that the tip of the catheter, initially placed in the right atrium of the heart had moved into the right ventricle.</p>
<p>Deputy State Coroner Scott Mitchell heard that the area around where the tip of the catheter had been found was inflamed and had suffered damage.</p>
<p>Kenneth Maclean, a paediatrician who had done a report on the baby's death, said that the final position of the tip of the catheter and the inflammation around the heart were causally related.</p>
<p>Michael Williams, SC, representing Tama's family, pointed out that the instructions on the package containing the catheter warned people using it to be careful. It had said: "Failure to do so may result in severe injury to the patient or death."</p>
<p>He said that the person inserting the catheter "well overshot the runway".</p>
<p>Mr Mitchell said he thought that doctors were bound to have read it because it was "such a significant event" inserting anything into the heart or close to the heart.</p>
<p>Mr Mitchell said that, according to his understand of the evidence, placing catheters into the heart was a dangerous procedure "if not lethal, if wrongly placed".</p>
<p>Dr McLean agreed.</p>
<p>Dr McLean said that some migration of the tip of the catheter was allowed for because of movement of the arm into which it had been placed and that it was not necessarily dangerous.</p>
<p>However, he said that, if the catheter tip migrated to where it was pressing against the wall of the heart, it could produce inflammation.</p>
<p>There could also be injury from the concentrated fluid being released by the catheter.</p>
<p>Dr McLean said that the doctor inserting the catheter on June 23, 2008, had initially put it lower in the heart but had withdrawn it five centimetres because of ectopic beats in the right ventricle.</p>
<p>Mr Williams, cross-examining, said that a withdrawal of five centimetres from where the tip of the catheter was initially placed seemed a huge margin of error.</p>
<p>Dr McLean said that the deeper the catheter went into the heart, the greater the risk, and the Federal Drugs Administration had said that catheter tips should not be allowed to migrate within the heart itself.</p>
<p>The inquiry continues.</p>
