<p>Hospital mistakenly bills patients for millions</p>
<p>New York:  Patients at a New York City hospital are getting billed for tens of millions of dollars because of a computer error.</p>
<p>Unemployed doorman Alexis Rodriguez says he almost became ill when he received a $44.8 million bill from the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center.</p>
<p>Rodriguez tells the New York Daily News (http://nydn.us/AjolYU )that he was hospitalized last spring with pneumonia and was afraid the bill was legit.</p>
<p>Turns out the company that prepares the bills had mistakenly put the invoice number in the space where the invoice amount should go.</p>
<p>The billing company is telling patients to ignore the multimillion-dollar bills. It says it will send out corrected ones.</p>
<p>The hospital didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday, which is a holiday.</p>
