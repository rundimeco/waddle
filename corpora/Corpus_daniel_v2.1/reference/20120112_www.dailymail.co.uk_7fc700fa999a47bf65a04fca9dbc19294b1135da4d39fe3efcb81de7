<p>Incompetent foreign doctors who can't speak English are putting NHS patients at risk</p>
<p>European laws are putting the lives of British patients at risk by allowing incompetent and poorly trained foreign doctors to work in the NHS, two senior doctors warned today.</p>
<p>Professor Norman Williams, president of the Royal College of Surgeons and Sir Richard Thompson, president of the Royal College of Physicians, say 'urgent action' is needed to combat 'huge variations' in the quality and training of foreign doctors.</p>
<p>The pair point out that many foreign-trained doctors are given jobs despite barely being able to speak English.</p>
<p>The issue resulted in tragic consequences in 2008 when David Gray died after he was administered ten times the required dose of the painkiller diamorphine by German locum Dr Daniel Ubani on his first shift in the UK.</p>
<p>Dr Ubani said he was confused about the difference between drugs used here and in Germany.</p>
<p>Almost a third of all doctors working within the UK - some 88,000 - are foreign-trained with around 22,758 of those coming from within the European Union.</p>
