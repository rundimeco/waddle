<p>Men have twice as many sexual partners as women</p>
<p>Men have an average of ten female sexual partners in their lifetime while women sleep with fewer than five men, a survey has found.</p>
<p>One in four women have only ever had one sexual partner, compared with 17 per cent of men, according to the Health Survey for England.</p>
<p>The results suggest Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who once claimed to have slept with "no more than 30 women", may have fared better than three men with average romantic conquests.</p>
<p>The data, published by the NHS Information Centre, showed 27 per cent of men claimed the number of their partners had reached double figures while just 13 per cent of women said they had had 10 or more partners of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>The report also showed a continuing trend of a growing number of girls first having sex under the age of 16</p>
<p>More than one in four women aged 16 to 24 first had sex under the age of consent compared with more than one in five men.</p>
