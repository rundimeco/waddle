<P>Brussel, 14 September 2000
<H3>
<P><B>Rural development programmes for Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Latvia and Slovenia endorsed</B></H3>
<P><I><B>Six rural development programmes to be co-financed by the EU's pre-accession instrument SAPARD</B></I><SUP><U>(1)</U></SUP><I><B> were endorsed in the STAR committee (Committee on agricultural structures and rural development). They cover Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Latvia and Slovenia. Welcoming the vote of the first set of programmes, EU Commissioner for Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries, Franz FISCHLER said </B></I><I><B>"Our objective is to channel funds to the applicant countries as fast as possible so that projects can get under way. The programmes outline how the agriculture and the agri-food sectors in the applicant countries are preparing for integration into the EU. The measures envisaged will play a key part in the adoption the </B></I><I><B>"acquis</B></I><I><B>" and help strengthen competitiveness in the run up to accession.</B></I><I><B>" 520 million EURO per year are earmarked for pre-accession aid under SAPARD. To safeguard the budget appropriation for the year 2000, Commissioner Fischler recalled that one more essential requirement remained to be satisfied after adoption of the Programmes, namely to draw-up the Multi-annual Financing Agreements. Thereafter the transfer of funds would be possible after Commission approval of the accreditation of the SAPARD agencies and conclusion of the Multi-annual and annual Financing Agreements.</B></I>
<P><B>What is SAPARD? </B>
<P>SAPARD was created to support the efforts being made by the Central and Eastern European applicant countries in the pre-accession period as they prepare for their participation in the common agricultural policy and the single market. The approach involves the delegation of substantial responsibility to the candidate countries regarding the management of EU funds for rural development and decentralised programming. This will give the future members an opportunity to gain experience in applying the mechanisms involved in rural development programmes. It will equally ease the management of the large number of small projects envisaged under SAPARD. The Regulation implementing SAPARD<SUP><U>(2)</U></SUP> adopted by the Commission on December 22, 1999 sets out the conditions for assistance in the areas eligible for expenditure such as investment in agricultural holdings and processing and marketing of products. 
<P>The overall budget in each year of the programme's seven-year run (2000-06) amounts to 520 million Euro, with the following indicative allocations:

<P><LI>Annual indicative SAPARD allocation (in million euro at constant 1999 prices): 168,683.
</UL><P>The rural development programme aims to exploit the opportunities available for the farm and food industry in Poland, including agri-tourism development and local product promotion both at home and abroad. It equally strives to address future threats such as lack of access to capital and limited development of infrastructure in rural areas. The programme builds on existing strengths, namely the good climatic conditions for agricultural development, while taking account of current weaknesses such as poor farm structures, overpopulation and low education level.
<P><B>Priorities for actions selected</B>
<P>The programme is based on two <B>priorities </B>outlined in the Polish plan: 
<UL><P><LI>Improvement of the market efficiency of the agri-food sector;
<P><LI>Improvement of conditions for economic activities and job creation;

<P>These measures are to contribute to the following strategic objectives:
<UL><P><LI>improvement of the economic viability of the Polish agri-food sector in both domestic and international markets;
<P><LI>adjustment of the Polish agri-food sector to health, hygiene and quality standards of the Single Market;
<P><LI>encouragement of multifunctional rural development, especially via developing technical infrastructure and creating conditions for non-agricultural economic activities in rural areas.

<P><B>Key facts and figures</B>
<UL><P><LI>Total area of the country: Â 93,030 kmÂ², of which 67% is agricultural land.
<P><LI>Population: 10,044,000, of which 73.5 % are living in rural areas 
<P><LI>Share of agriculture in GDP: 5.0 % in 1998   (12.5% in 1990)

<P><LI>Share of agri-food products in GDP: 4 % 
<P><LI>Agri-food sector: Food industry in Hungary employs about 3-4% of the total labour force.
<P><LI>Annual indicative SAPARD allocation (in million euro at constant 1999 prices): 38,054
</UL><P>The rural development programme aims to exploit the opportunities available for the farm and food industry in Hungary, including a widening market for unique, special and quality products and growing demand for organic products. It equally strives to address future threats such as depopulation and the lack of financial resources in rural areas. The programme builds on existing strengths, such as the highly educated labour force, while taking account of current weaknesses such as too many smallholders with very small and scattered land plots.
<P><B>Priorities for actions selected</B>

<P><B>Objectives to be achieved</B>
<P>The most important tasks for the agricultural sector in the Czech Republic are to assure the introduction of the <I>acquis communautaire</I> in practice, to strengthen competitiveness in primary production and the manufacturing industries, to attain a higher quality of agricultural and food products with higher added value, to finalise restructuring of agricultural and manufacturing plants, and to improve the position of primary agricultural production on the market. A specific task is to create preconditions for clear identification of land ownership and the development of a land market as well as to focus on support of other agriculture functions such as maintaining the landscape and recreation.
<P>The main objective in the field of rural development is to contribute to : 
<UL><P><LI>- a suitable economic environment for the stability of the population,
<P><LI>-  the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and 
<P><LI>- better utilisation of local resources
</UL><P>with the objective of achieving stable income in rural areas, reducing unemployment and making better use of the existing potential for ensuring the vitality and viability of these areas.

</UL><P>The Latvian programme has two overall objectives; firstly, the implementation of the <I>acquis communautaire</I> concerning the common agricultural policy and related policies; secondly, to develop competitive and sustainable agriculture, strong, sustainable rural communities and diverse and sustainable rural environment.
<P><B>Three specific objectives</B>
<P>These overall objectives are further divided into specific objectives, the first of which is to increase competitiveness and farming income level and to increase the incomes of agricultural enterprises. This is concentrated in the area of Objective No 1, which focuses on the development of sustainable agriculture. Under Objective No 1, there are two priorities to be addressed using the following measures: </P><P><TABLE BORDER WIDTH=80%><TR><TD>
