<P><B>Commission proposes Directive to ensure harmonisation of Measuring Instruments</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has adopted a proposal for a Directive on measuring instruments, which are of EU-wide significance. Examples of such instruments are taximeters, petrol pump counters, breathalysers,  water-, gas- and electricity meters and automatic weighing instruments used in production lines for pre-packed products.</B></I>
<P>Enterprise Commissioner Erkki Liikanen said: "The draft was the subject of a wide consultation with national authorities, industry, users, consumers and other interested parties, and is based on a wide consensus. It is one of the final pieces of legislation for the internal market in products. By guaranteeing certainty of measurement and alignment with international standards, it opens a large market to manufacturers in- and outside the European Union."
<P>The Commission's proposal represents a significant simplification in that it  will replace 11 existing directives and many national laws. In line with the principle of subsidiarity, the proposal does not harmonise national laws that impose a particular legal measurement This remains the competence of the Member State.  However, if a particular measurement is imposed, the proposal provides that it can only be carried out by means of an instrument conforming to the proposal.
<P>Legally controlled measuring instruments are traditionally required in most Member States in order to ensure trust between parties in transactions, to protect consumers and, more recently, to ensure objective measurement of offences, for instance alcohol abuse. At EU level, a number of measuring instruments has been harmonised many years ago. However, the existing directives have not been updated to take account of technological progress, notably digital micro-electronics, or of new types of instruments. Meanwhile Member States have to different degrees expanded parallel national technical regulations, which has tended to fragment the internal market. It is therefore considered necessary to update EU regulation in order to achieve better harmonisation and to modernise the existing conformity assessment procedures to include an approved and supervised Quality System as an alternative to third party verification of products. A key role is given to international and European standardisation.
<P>The Commission proposal is intended to improve the internal market and to ensure the protection of consumers and trust between parties in transactions. It will give manufacturers a choice of conformity assessment procedures and allows them to fully benefit from technological progress and international standardisation work.
