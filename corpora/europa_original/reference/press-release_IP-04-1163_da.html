<a name="Heading4"></a><b>Kommissionen arrangerer offentlig
høring om en styrkelse af det økonomiske partnerskab mellem EU og USA
</b></h1>
<p><b><i>Europa-Kommissionen igangsatte i dag en offentlig høring af alle
interesserede parter om, hvordan det transatlantiske økonomiske partnerskab
kan styrkes. Denne høring udgør det første skridt på vejen
mod virkeliggørelse af EU’s og USA’s fælles erklæring
om en styrkelse af deres økonomiske partnerskab, der blev vedtaget af
formanden for Kommissionen Romano Prodi, USA’s præsident George W.
Bush og den irske premierminister Bertie Ahern på topmødet mellem EU
og USA den 26. juni 2004 i Irland. Kommissionen opfordrer erhvervslivet,
miljø- og forbrugerorganisationer, fagforeninger og andre interesserede
parter og enkeltpersoner til at give deres besyv med om de hindringer, de
står over for, når de køber og sælger eller investerer
på hinandens markeder og om de fremtidige handelsforbindelser og
økonomiske forbindelser mellem EU og USA.</i></b></p>
<p>Det vedlagte dokument indeholder en række spørgsmål til alle
interesserede parter og opfordrer dem til at komme med ideer og forslag.</p>
<p>Den offentlige høring finder sted i løbet af oktober og november
2004. Resultaterne herfra vil blive sammenfattet, analyseret og sammenholdt med
resultaterne af en lignende høring, som gennemføres af USA's regering.
Herefter vil begge parter udarbejde politiske løsninger til brug for en
fælles langsigtet strategi, der skal fremlægges af den
europæisk-amerikanske embedsmandsgruppe på højt plan på det
næste topmøde mellem EU og USA i 2005.</p>
<p>Denne høring skal give nye ideer til, hvordan man kan styrke den
transatlantiske økonomiske integration, øge investeringer, handel,
innovation og jobskabelse og overvinde hindringer for virkeliggørelse af
vore økonomiers konkurrencepotentiale.</p>
<p>Det bilaterale handels- og investeringsforhold mellem EU og USA er verdens
mest omfattende, og de to parter er hinandens største handels- og
investeringspartnere. Handelen omfattede i 2003 varer og tjenesteydelser til en
værdi af mere end 600 mia. EUR. Det europæiske erhvervslivs direkte
investeringer i USA udgør 890 mia. EUR, og de tilsvarende amerikanske
investeringer i EU udgør 650 mia. EUR, svarende til samlede investeringer
på mere end 1 500 mia. EUR.</p>
<p>Høringen varer frem til den 30. november 2004 og gennemføres via
hjemmesiderne for Europa-Kommissionens generaldirektorater for henholdsvis
handel og eksterne forbindelser. En præsentation, et link til

<p align="center"><b>Strengthening the EU-US Economic Partnership</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>Request for comments and proposals of the services of the
European Commission</b></p>
<p>1. EU and US leaders agreed at the EU-US Summit in June 2004 to look at new
ways to make the transatlantic economic relationship stronger, and to give it
new impetus. Presidents Prodi and Bush and Prime Minister Ahern called for
innovative proposals to further develop the transatlantic market in the
21<sup>st</sup> century. They called on all interested parties “on both
sides of the Atlantic to engage in a vigorous discussion of concrete ideas on
how to further transatlantic economic integration to the fullest, spur
innovation and job creation, and better realise the competitive potential of our
economies and
enterprises”.<sup><b><a name="fnB1" href="#fn1">[1]</a></b></sup></p>
<p>2. This consultative document sets out some key elements of the Transatlantic
Economic Partnership and requests comments and proposals from stakeholders. The
US Government is running a similar consultation.</p>
<p><b>Purpose of this consultation</b></p>
<p>3. The starting point of this exercise is the existing strong economic
partnership between the EU and the US as set out in the annex. This consultation
is aimed at bringing forward new ideas on how to further transatlantic economic
integration, to enhance the flow of investment as well as trade, and to identify
and overcome obstacles to the realisation of the competitive potential of our
economies. In this consultation, the Commission services want to go beyond the
annual review of trade barriers on which the Commission and US Government
publish reports<sup><b><a name="fnB2" href="#fn2">[2]</a></b></sup> and to
consider more far-reaching ideas. </p>
<p>4 The Commission services are, therefore, looking for concrete proposals to
develop the EU/US economic partnership from all segments of civil society,
including business, trade unions, environmental and consumer NGOs, and academic
circles.</p>
<p>5. It is understood that any new effort to promote transatlantic economic
integration would have to take account of systemic differences, such as
differing ways of governance and public attitudes, which also shape our
transatlantic economic relationship and can be a source of misunderstanding and
sometimes friction. Among these differences the following can be identified:
</p>
<ul>
<li>existence in the US of many federal and sub-federal agencies with
independent powers, which the US Administration cannot override;</li>
<li>more frequent resort in the US towards using litigation to solve disputes,
whereas the EU leans towards regulatory options and compliance;</li>
<li>different public attitudes to risk, safety and precaution.</li></ul><p>6.
Finally, the endeavour to strengthen our bilateral economic partnership should
be placed within the broader context of our common aim to continue developing
sound economic ties with the rest of the world and notably with the developing
countries. Our renewed partnership should also contribute to the advancement of
this and other aspects of our co-operation, such as sustainable development.    
</p>
<p><b>Consultation</b></p>
<p>The Commission services are interested in your views, <i>inter alia</i> on
the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Q1: What in your view are the most significant obstacles to closer EU-US
economic integration?</li>
<li>Q2: What practical measures should be undertaken to remove the
obstacles?</li>
<li>Q3: What additional measures could be taken to further transatlantic
economic integration to the fullest, spur innovation, create jobs and better
realise the competitive potential of our economies and enterprises?</li>
<li>Q4:  The EU-US bilateral trade and economic agenda has achieved some
progress, especially through the Financial Markets Regulatory Dialogue, the
Guidelines for Regulatory Cooperation and Transparency, the Galileo-GPS
agreement on satellite navigation and the Mutual Recognition Agreement on marine
equipment. Should more of this be done? Which new areas do you suggest?</li>
<li>Q5: What measures would be appropriate to promote good corporate governance
and reliable financial information in the transatlantic market?</li>
<li>Q6: Can you suggest essential steps that should be taken to ease
transatlantic direct and indirect investment?</li>
<li>Q7: Do you have any proposals on how to protect the environment, consumer
interests and health and safety as well as labour standards, while
simultaneously promoting further economic integration?</li>
<li>Q8: To what extent do new border and transport security measures have an
impact on trade, investment and travel? If they do have a negative impact, what
remedies would you propose?</li>
<li>Q9: Does the administration of export controls and transfers of know how in
the US and the EU work satisfactorily in balancing the objectives of trade and
security? If not, what measures should be taken jointly to improve the
situation?</li>
<li>Q10: What additional steps, if any, should be taken jointly to protect
Intellectual Property Rights? </li>
<li>Q11: Do you experience problems when tendering for public contracts in the
US? If so, what should be done to remedy these problems?</li>
<li>Q12: What should be done to further liberalise transatlantic trade in
services, including professional qualifications?</li>
<li>Q13:  Do you think that a further reduction or elimination of tariffs
between the EU and US is important? If so, which or in which sectors?</li>
<li>Q14:  Do you have any comment on the possible impact that strengthening
EU-US bilateral integration might have on the multilateral trading system and
the interests of developing countries?</li>
<li>Q15: How can we enhance transparency and public participation in the
transatlantic economic dialogue?</li>
<li>Q16: Do you have any other comments or suggestions?</li></ul><p>7. The
services of the Commission would like to receive input from this consultation
from a wide range of stakeholders with interests in the EU-US economic
relationship. If you wish to let us have your thoughts on any part of this
consultation document, please send in your reply to reach us by <b><u>30
November 2004</u></b>. </p>
<p>The online form is available at:</p>
<p><a
href="http://ec.europa.eu/yourvoice/consultations/index_da.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/yourvoice/consultations/index_da.htm</a></p>
<p>Your replies will help to formulate policy options which could in turn feed
into a joint strategy to enhance EU -US economic partnership an eliminate
barriers.</p>
<p>In parallel, between now and the end of November the Commission intends to
organise a stakeholder event in Brussels. It is expected that this will be
supplemented by some events organised by national Governments of member states.
These activities will give further opportunities for you to contribute your
views.</p>
<p align="right"><b>Annex</b></p>
<p><b>The transatlantic economic relationship</b></p>
<p>The EU and US form the largest trade and investment relationship in the world
and are each other’s largest trade and investment partners. The volume of
trade in 2003 comprised more than € 600 bn ($ 725 bn) worth of goods and
services<sup><b><a name="fnB3" href="#fn3">[3]</a></b></sup>. Large as this is,
it is now far outweighed by the flow of investment. In 2003, the EU had €
890 bn of direct investment in the US while the US had € 650 bn in the EU;
a total of over € 1.5 trillion ($ 1.8 trn). Today investment constitutes
the most significant element of our economic relationship.</p>
<p>The EU and the US have a long history of close cooperation in GATT and then
the WTO, most recently illustrated over the adoption of a new Doha Round
framework in July. This cooperation has underpinned this high level of economic
interdependence, despite the absence of any formal trade/investment agreement
between the EU and US.</p>
<p><b>The structure of our economic cooperation framework</b></p>
<p>With the aim of structuring discussions over issues that arise in trade, and
over steps to build closer cooperation, the EU and the US have adopted some
formal arrangements that have been built up over the past ten years. The
framework of the EU-US economic relationship goes beyond trade and investment
and includes a number of institutionalised dialogues and growing regulatory
cooperation between the partners. The main elements of this framework are
described below. The EU and the US also cooperate in numerous multilateral
organisations.</p>
<p><u>The New Transatlantic Agenda</u><b> </b>(NTA) and the accompanying
<u>EU-US Joint Action Plan</u> of December 1995 created a senior level dialogue
structure and embarked on a series of concrete cooperative endeavours. One of
the aims of the NTA is “to create a New Transatlantic Marketplace by
progressively reducing or eliminating barriers that hinder flow of goods,
services and capital between us”.</p>
<p>The <u>Transatlantic Economic Partnership</u> (TEP) agreed in May 1998 lays
the foundations to enable the EU and US to intensify their efforts to reduce or
eliminate barriers to trade and investment between them notably through closer
co-operation between regulators. It allows them to focus initiatives on areas
where there is goodwill on both sides and where gains can be enormous –
for example financial markets. It promotes upstream convergence or mutual
recognition of rules and standards; and it acts as an early warning mechanism in
case a potentially damaging piece of legislation is in the pipeline. In November
1998 the European Commission and the US Administration adopted a rolling work
programme, entitled the <u>TEP Action Plan</u>. This document identifies areas
for common actions both bilaterally and multilaterally. Some elements of the
plan take the form of trade negotiations, others are achieved through
co-operative actions. </p>
<p>In order to manage day-to-day transatlantic trade and investment relations,
the <u>TEP Steering Group </u>(SG) was set up. It monitors the realisation of
TEP objectives and provides a horizontal forum for bilateral consultation and
early warning on any matter of trade and investment relevance, with a view to
preventing conflicts and resolving trade frictions. It is also responsible for
implementing and developing the <u>Positive Economic Agenda (PEA)</u> – a
series of positive and specific trade-related initiatives designed in May 2002
to promote co-operation and mutual commercial benefit. Activities under the PEA
include the implementation of the Guidelines on Regulatory Cooperation and
Transparency, developed in 2002 under the TEP, and the Financial Markets
Dialogue, a forum for the discussion of complex bilateral financial and
regulatory issues.</p>
