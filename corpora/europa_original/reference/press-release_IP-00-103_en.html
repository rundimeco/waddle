<P><B>Commission opens formal investigation into State aid to Kvaerner Warnow Werft </B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has decided to open the formal investigation procedure as regards some of the aid paid to Kvaerner Warnow Werft GmbH in 1993-1995 in the context of its restructuring. The aid in question is part of the DEM 513 million (</B></I><I><B>€ 232.2 m) of operating aid paid to the yard to cover future losses relating to contracts. Since the actual losses turned out to be DEM 119.3 million (</B></I><I><B>€ 61 m) lower than the loss compensation paid to the yard, the Commission has doubts whether this excess amount is compatible with the common market.</B></I>
<P>Kvaerner Warnow Werft GmbH (KWW), a subsidiary of Norvegian Kvaerner a.s., is the biggest undertaking in Rostock-Warnemünde employing around 1.300 workers. This former Eastern German shipyard was privatised in 1992 and was totally restructured with help of state aid approved by four Commission decisions during 1993-1995.  In total, the Commission approved DEM 1247 million (€ 637.5 m ) in aid, in  accordance with Directives 90/684/EEC and 92/68/EEC on aid to shipbuilding.
<P>In the summer of 1999 the Commission found out that KWW had given a DEM 400 million (€ 204.05 m) loan to its mother company Kvaerner a.s. The Commission then started investigating the origin of the money in order to ensure that it did not contain any restructuring aid paid to the yard in 1993-1995 or any other aid elements. The investigations revealed that the yard had received DEM 513 million (€ 232.2 m) for  compensation of losses during the restructuring period, whereas the actual losses to be covered by this aid turned out to be DEM 119.3 million (€ 59.6 m) less. This would contravene the provisions in the Commission decisions approving the aid, according to which yards in the new Länder shall only receive the aid necessary for their restructuring The Commission therefore has doubts about the compatibility with EU State aid rules of the excess aid received by KWW.
