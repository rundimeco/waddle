<P><B>Commission clears Boeing</B><B>'s acquisition of the satellite business of Hughes Electronics</B></H3>
<P><I><B>After an in-depth investigation, the European Commission has decided to clear the proposed acquisition by the Boeing Company of the satellite business of Hughes Electronics Corporation. The investigation dismissed earlier doubts that the operation could significantly strengthen Hughes</B></I><I><B>' position in commercial geostationary communication satellites (</B></I><I><B>"GEO satellites</B></I><I><B>") as well as the concern that the parties might induce Hughes</B></I><I><B>' satellite customers to procure launch services from Boeing. The Commission has therefore decided that the acquisition will not lead to the creation or strengthening of a dominant position on these markets.</B></I>
<P>Boeing is active in commercial aircraft, defence and space industries. The US-based company supplies navigation satellites and has substantial activities in the field of satellite launch services, where it operates its family of Delta launchers and has an interest in Sea Launch, another launch service operator.
<P>Hughes, a subsidiary of General Motors, is the world's leading manufacturer of commercial GEO satellites. It produces certain satellite equipment and provides satellite-based communication services and pay-TV.
<P>The proposed transaction will combine the parties' satellite manufacturing activities and result in vertical integration between Hughes' satellite operations and Boeing's launch activities.
<P>Hughes is currently the market leader for commercial GEO satellites, with market shares around 35-40%. It was considered that the operation could further enlarge the gap between Hughes Space and Communications (HSC) and its competitors.
<P>Following the results of the Commission's detailed investigation, it appears that HSC is and will remain subject to the competition from other large satellite prime contractors, such as Lockheed Martin, S/S Loral, Alcatel Space Industries and Astrium.
<P>In particular, it appears that HSC's  will probably not be significantly strengthened as a result of the transaction since HSC's severance from the Hughes group will not create new major opportunities for HSC, and might instead cause HSC to lose the custom of Hughes' satellite operating companies (PanAmSat, DirecTV and Hughes Network Systems), which represented approximately 45% of HSC's satellite orders between 1997 and 1999. In the light of the above, the Commission concluded that the operation will not create or strengthen a dominant position on that particular market.
<P>The Commission also investigated whether the parties could induce Hughes customers to choose Boeing as a launch service operator by making the integration of its satellites with third party launch vehicles more expensive than in the case of Boeing vehicles.  There were also fears that Hughes could influence the launch vehicle selection to the advantage of Boeing in the case of Delivery In Orbit contracts. 
<P>The extensive customer enquiry conducted by the Commission indicated that HSC would be more likely to lose contracts in the case it decided to increase the costs of integration of its satellites to non-Boeing launchers.
<P>Finally, the Commission investigated claims that, in the light of current over-capacity in the launch service industry and with the launch service sector being subject to considerable fixed costs, a few won or lost launches could make a substantial difference and possibly trigger a snowball effect in which Boeing's competitors would lose additional launches as they became less cost competitive.
<P>The results of the in-depth investigation of the Commission showed that the possibility for a snowball effect essentially depends on the cost structure of the launch service operators remaining unchanged. However, it appears that some of the major competitors engaged in cost reduction programmes. Moreover, commercial launches do not represent all of their launches, so that a loss of competitiveness on the commercial market could be more than offset by new contracts on the government side. It remains highly questionable whether the implementation of a vicious circle would lead to the monopolisation of the launch service sector as it appears that, should a launch vehicle supplier become less cost-competitive, it would try to cut prices in order to salvage volume and recoup at least a part of its fixed costs.  The most likely outcome of the identified adverse effects would therefore be greater price competition rather than market monopolisation.
<P>In the light of the above, it appears that the notified operation does not create or strengthen a dominant position on the markets for launch services as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded in the EEA or any substantial part of that area. Therefore, the notified concentration has been declared compatible with the common market.
<P>In the course of the proceedings, the parties offered a series of commitments aiming at comforting the Commission in its decision.  The commitments ensure that (i) any non-public information relative to launchers or satellites) which HSC launchers (respectively Boeing or Sea Launch) could receive will not be provided or disclosed to Boeing or Sea Launch or HSC; (ii) HSC will make information relative to its satellites available to other launch service operators at the same time HSC makes such information available to Boeing or Sea Launch; (iii) HSC will co-operate with launch service operators other than Boeing or Sea Launch for the integration of its satellites with launch vehicles, without discriminating in favour of Boeing or Sea Launch; and (iv) there will be no "preferred supplier" relationship between the merged entity and Hughes. The Commission takes note of these undertakings, but they are not a condition to the approval.
<P>Pursuant to the bilateral agreement of 1991 on antitrust co-operation between the European Commission and the United States of America, the European Commission has closely co-operated with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the analysis of the transaction that is also being investigated by the FTC. The Commission's decision in this case does not prejudice the outcome of the assessment in the United States.
