<P><B>Statement by President PRODI on the Danish Referendum</B></H3>
<P>Romano Prodi, President of the European Commission, issued the following statement on the Danish Referendum:
<P>"The Danish people have confirmed that they do not want to adopt the Euro as their currency. 
<P>The Commission regrets this decision and I firmly believe that a positive vote would have been in our common interest. I welcome the fact that the Danish authorities do not plan to modify the conditions under which the Krone participates in the Exchange Rate Mechanism. 
<P>My understanding is also that Denmark will continue commitment to an economic policy based on macroeconomic stability, which closely shadows Euro-area policies and objectives.
<P>Since 1 January 1999, the Euro has been the currency of 11 Member States.  Soon there will be 12. The good results already achieved after 21 months will not be affected by the Danish decision:
<UL><P><LI>the Euro-zone economic fundamentals are the best in a generation
<P><LI>employment is growing constantly and the budgetary situation is increasingly robust
<P><LI>the Euro has established itself in the financial markets as a global currency and the volume of bond issues is similar to that of the US dollar.
</UL><P>The deepening of economic union continues to be our main task. 
<UL><P><LI>The process of economic reform is well under way. It will be strengthened. 
<P><LI>The capacity to deal with external shocks, like the rise in the oil price, has also to be strengthened. 
</UL><P>I am sure the Eurogroup will carry on its good work and contribute to the deepening of the economic and monetary union. The Commission will be active in promoting this process, while maintaining the cohesion of the Union as a whole."
