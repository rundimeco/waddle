<P><B>The Commission authorises FF 26 billion (</B><B>€4 billion) in State aid to the French coal industry</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission is allowing France to give its coal industry the State aid it notified to the Commission for 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000. The aid has been authorised under Decision 3632/93/ECSC on Community rules for aid from Member States to the coal industry .</B></I>
<P>Under the National Coal Pact signed in 1994 by Charbonnages de France and the unions, coal mines are to be gradually closed down by 2005. On 20 September 2000 the Commission authorised the aid notified by France since 1997 following a proposal by Vice-President Loyola de Palacio. The aid is limited to two categories:
<UL><P><LI>Aid for the reduction of activity (Article 4 of Decision 3632/93/ECSC) to cover the difference between production costs and the selling price of coal. The aid forms part of a plan to close down the pits concerned;
<P><LI>Aid to cover exceptional costs (Article 5 of Decision 3632/93/ECSC) to cover inherited liabilities not related to current production.
</UL><P>The Commission's go-ahead for the aid proposed for 1997 to 2000 - four consecutive years - comes after long discussions with the French authorities. The Commission had to make sure that all the conditions laid down in Decision 3632/93/ECSC were strictly met. The French authorities have taken the necessary action in this respect.
<P>All coal mines in France are included in a closure plan and therefore receive aid for the reduction of activity to cover their operating losses. This was a vital factor in the Commission's decision. The absence of any significant downward trend in production costs and the level of these costs (about €150 per tonne of coal) rule out any prospect of long-term competitiveness in coal mining.
<P>The aid can be broken down as follows:
<UL><P><LI>For 1997, FF 2454 million for the reduction of activity and FF 3869 million to cover exceptional costs;
<P><LI>For 1998, FF 2533 million for the reduction of activity and FF 4059 million to cover exceptional costs;
<P><LI>For 1999, FF 2324 million for the reduction of activity and FF 4135 million to cover exceptional costs;
<P><LI>For 2000, FF 2556 million for the reduction of activity and FF 4071 million to cover exceptional costs.
</UL><P>The Commission has taken special account of the French coal industry's social and regional difficulties in making its decision. The spread of the closures should help to reduce the impact of these measures in regions already affected by the reduction in coal mining. The aid authorised by the Commission should also contribute to solving the problems brought about by these reductions.
