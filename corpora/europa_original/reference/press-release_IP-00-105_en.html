<P><B>Commission approves joint venture between General Electric Company (USA) and Thomson-CSF (France) in the field of flight simulator training.</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has approved an operation by which General Electric Company and Thomson-CSF will create a joint venture for the purpose of carrying out the civil flight simulator training currently provided by General Electric Company</B></I><I><B>'s subsidiary CEGAT and Thomson-CSF</B></I><I><B>'s subsidiary ORBIT. The concentration does not give rise to competition concerns as the market shares are low and the market highly competitive.</B></I>
<P>General Electric will via its subsidiary CEGL own 66% of the joint venture and Thomson-CSF the remaining 34%. The Board of the joint venture will consist of six members. Four including the chairman will be appointed by GECL and two by Thomson-CSF. Decisions of the Board will be taken by simple majority vote. However in important matters both Thomson-CSF and CEGL have a veto right.
<P>The relevant product market is the market for civil flight simulator training, and the Commission's investigation revealed that the market share of the joint venture in this market is relatively low whatever geographic market is considered for those services. 
<P>For these reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose the concentration and to declare it compatible with the common market.
