<P><B>David Byrne welcomes first World Heart Day </B></H3>
<P><I><B>Commissioner Byrne today spoke out in support of the World Heart Day initiative. Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in both developed and developing countries. It is the largest single cause of death for people in the EU, accounting for 16.6% of all deaths in 1996.  However, simple adjustments of lifestyle can have a dramatic impact on the prevention of heart problems and their management. Thirty minutes of walking, biking or other moderate exercise a day will halve an adult's risk of heart disease. Today, this is the key message sent out all over the world at the occasion of the first ever World Heart Day. </B></I>
<P>Health and Consumer Protection Commissioner David Byrne today welcomed the World Heart Day: "This initiative has my full and warm support. We should all be aware that simple daily physical activity like a thirty minute walk, or biking, gardening, dancing and even housework have been proven to help prevent heart disease. One of the main causes of heart problems - besides smoking and unhealthy dietary habits - is physical inactivity. A daily thirty-minute walk brings huge benefits to personal health and well being. But too many people still do not get around to making some form of exercise part of their daily routines. The cost of such habits to individual health and to society is significant, and increasing. With an ageing population in developed countries and social and economic risk factors on the rise in developing countries, heart disease is set to take a heavy toll world wide, unless we can convince ourselves to change our ways. So preventive action on a global level is a clear necessity.  The European Commission, through its support to the European Heart Health Initiative, helps to make this effort a reality".
<P>Recent medical research has emphasised the benefits of moderate but regular exercise in reducing the risk of heart disease. Every adult should accumulate 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity, preferably each and every day. A healthy diet, no smoking, avoiding overweight and stress are other elements of a lifestyle that will keep your heart on the beat and prevent cardiovascular disorders. Inactivity on the contrary doubles the risk of heart disease. Medical advice to patients always underlines the importance of regular moderate exercise, but, it appears from recent research data, such advice is insufficiently taken to heart and put into practice. 
<P>Heart disease is the number one cause of death in Europe, accounting for nearly half of all deaths. World Heart Day is an initiative of the World Heart Federation, a non-governmental organisation promoting the study, prevention and care of cardiovascular diseases. World Heart Day is meant to become a recurrent event and supported by the World Health Organisation and UNESCO. The European Heart Network, a Brussels based NGO, and the European Society of Cardiology have urged European policy makers to facilitate exercise in working and school environments.
