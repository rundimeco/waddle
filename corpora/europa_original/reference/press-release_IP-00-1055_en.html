<P><B>Commission clears acquisition of joint control of Bravida by Telenor and Procuritas Capital Partners.</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has approved the merger of the electrical installation businesses of Norway</B></I><I><B>'s telecommunications firm Telenor and Scandinavian equity investment firm Procuritas Capital Partners. The deal will have no significant effect on the current structure of the market.</B></I>
<P>According to the terms of the deal, Telenor will merge its subsidiary Bravida with BPA, the electrical installation business owned by Investeringss√§lskabet 1999 AB (ISAB), which is controlled by Procuritas Capital Partners. Procuritas is a Scandinavian equity investment company that specialises in initiating, structuring and financing management boyouts. 
<P>The new entity, also called Bravida, will be active in Sweden and Norway. The parties' combined shares of the market at stake do not exceed 15% in these two countries and there is no creation or strengthening of a dominant position. 
<P>Telenor is active in several markets that can be characterised as vertically related to electrical installation services. However, the addition of BPA's installation business to the pre-existing links between Telenor and Bravida does not give rise to any foreclosure effects in Norway as BPA is not a significant player on the Norwegian market for electrical installations.
