<P><B>Commission revokes previous decision ordering recovery of  aid from SNIACE S.A., Spain </B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has decided to revoke a 1998 negative decision concerning measures in favour of SNIACE S.A., a viscose and synthetic fibres producer located in Torrelavega, Cantabria, Spain. The Commission had originally concluded that the measures, namely agreements to defer social security debts and a repayment agreement with the Wage Guarantee Fund (FOGASA), constituted unlawful aid. However in the light of a judgement of the European Court of Justice in a similar case, the Commission has reviewed its previous decision and concluded that no aid was involved.  </B></I>
<P>In its 1998 decision, which has been challenged by Spain before the Court of Justice, the Commission had concluded that the repayment agreements between Sniace and the wages fund Fogasa and the rescheduling agreement between Sniace and the Social Security Treasury contained incompatible aid, in so far as the rate of interest was below market rates. 
<P>However in April last year the Court of Justice decided to annul the Commission's decision in a similar case (C-342/96 Spain vs. Commission on State aid granted by Spain in favour of Tubacex). The Court noted that in these kind of repayment and rescheduling agreements, the State did not act as a public investor whose conduct must be compared to the conduct of a private investor laying out capital with a view to realising a profit, but as a public creditor which, like a private creditor, seeks to recover sums due to it. 
<P>The Commission therefore decided to re-examine the Sniace file to look again at how the public creditors had acted compared with the company's private creditors, with whom it had reached an agreement after it had got into financial difficulties and suspended debt repayments. The Commission concluded that by applying the so-called legal interest rate, the public creditors had acted as well as a private creditor would have done in order to maximise the rate of interest on arrears.  Consequently the Commission took the view that the measures did not constitute state aid and that the previous decision should be revoked.
