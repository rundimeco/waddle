<P><I><B>In partnership with the European Parliament and the Member States, the Commission promotes a public debate with the citizens and the elected representatives throughout the Union called the </B></I><I><B>« Dialogue on Europe </B></I><I><B>» The scheme has already generated more than 20 debate opportunities with a total of over 3600 citizens.

About 65 other such dialogue events are foreseen until the end of this year.

<P>Since its launching on March, the Dialogue on Europe has developed into a permanent forum of discussions with European citizens.  An electronic newsletter <A HREF="mailto:Dialogue@info">Dialogue@info</A> as well as an interactive website <A HREF="http://ec.europa.eu/igc2000/dialogue/index_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/archives/igc2000/dialogue/index_en.htm</A> and more than 20 debate opportunities took place in the first part of the year. Members of the European Parliament took themselves an active role in discussing with the citizens, together with national ministers and Commissioners.
<P>A chat on the Internet was also organised on June 5 with the participation of Michel Barnier, European Commissioner for regional policy and institutional reform.
<P>The website offers as well since September an Internet DISCUSSION FORUM on the future of Europe : <A HREF="http://ec.europa.eu/igc2000/dialogue/debate/contributions/index_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/archives/igc2000/dialogue/debate/contributions/index_en.htm</A>
