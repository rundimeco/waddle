<P><B>Commission clears Salzgitter buy of  steel tubes maker Mannesmannr</B><B>öhren-Werke</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has approved, under both the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty and the Merger Regulation, the acquisition of German-based tube maker Mannesmannr</B></I><I><B>öhren-Werke AG by Salzgitter AG. </B></I>
<P>Salzgitter AG is a German integrated steel producer which makes and distributes a wide range of products, including large diameter spirally welded pipe. 
<P>Mannesmannröhren-Werke AG (MRW), which is currently owned by Mannesmann AG (99.7%) and Thyssen (0.7%) was established in 1970 and is engaged in the production of steel tubes and pipes and of the feedstock for such products. Salzgitter will acquire the shares held by Mannesmann AG
<P>MRW jointly with Dillingerhütte controls Europipe, a company set up in 1991 to take over the large diameter longitudinally welded pipe (LDLWP) interests of MRW and the LDLWP and spiral welded pipe operations of France's Usinor. MRW also controls Hüttenwerke Krupp Mannesmann jointly with Thyssen Krupp which produces semi-finished products for its parents.
<P>The operation presents overlaps in the production of semi-finished products, quarto plate and large diameter welded tubes. But the Commission's investigation showed that there no competition problems in either of these areas. 
<P>During the Commission's examination of the proposed operation, a number of smaller manufacturers of large diameter tubes who purchase raw materials from Salzgitter expressed concern that after the operation this source of supply might no longer be available to them on competitive terms. To allay these fears Salzgitter has made a declaration that it will continue to provide plate and hot rolled wide strip on non-discriminatory terms. The Commission's Decision taken under the ECSC Treaty takes note of this declaration.
