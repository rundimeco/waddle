<P><B>Measures to compensate farmers for adverse climat events in Italy</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has taken a final negative decision on the granting of state aids to compensate farmers for a series of adverse climatic events in Sardinia (Italy). The objective of the law was to enable the region of Sardinia to pay compensation to make good the damage caused by a series of adverse climat changes, such as drought, going back as far as 1988. They have only been notified to the Commission in 1998. The Commission already opened state aid procedure in May 1999.</B></I>
<P>The Commission objects to these state aids for a combination of two reasons :
<P>First, most of the events for which compensation is intended lie far back . Until  the entry into force of its new guidelines for state aid in the Agricultural Sector on 1 Jan 1, 2000 the CommissionÂ´s constant practice in respect of the payment of aid to compensate for adverse climatic events did not provide for an express time limit for the payment of aid. However, it has always been implicit to those provisions that the aid should be paid within a reasonable period of time after the occurrence of the event. Otherwise, it is hard to see how such an aid can still be seen to make good the damage caused by the natural disaster, as is required by the EC Treaty. Where aid is proposed several years after the occurrence (up to ten years in the present case), there is a real risk that the aid will create a distortion of competition. Where producers have taken steps to absorb the losses resulting from past adverse events, belated compensation would produce similar economic effects to the payment of operating aids.
<P>Second, the measures proposed to give preference to farmers in difficulties, instead of treating equally all farmers who had actually suffered from the climatic events. Therefore, the measures would seem to be aid for companies in difficulties rather than compensation for adverse climatic events. Consequently, the strict rules for rescue and restructuring would have to be respected. However, the Italian authorities did not show that this was the case.
<P>In its new guidelines for state aid in the Agricultural Sector (which were not applicable yet in this case), the Commission states that it will not approve proposals for aid in relation to natural disasters which are submitted more than three years after the occurrence of the event.
