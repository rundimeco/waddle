<a name="Heading4"></a><b>State Aid: the Commission authorises French
aid scheme for video game creation</b></h1>
<h2>
<a name="Heading7"></a><b><i>The European Commission has authorised, under the
EC Treaty rules on state aid, a French tax credit aimed at encouraging video
game creation. This tax credit may be granted only to video games that meet the
criteria of quality, originality, and contributing to cultural diversity. After
an in-depth investigation that began in 2006 (see <a
href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/1602&format=HTML&aged=1&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">IP/06/1602</a>),
the Commission has concluded that this measure qualifies for the exemption
provided for by the EC Treaty for aid to promote culture.</i></b></h2>
<p>Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: “The French authorities
have made significant changes to the scheme so as to essentially target video
games with cultural content and minimise possible distortions of competition in
the European market”.</p>
<p>The aim of the aid scheme is to enable video game manufacturers which are
subject to taxation in France to deduct up to 20% of the production costs of
certain games. Only video games that meet certain criteria will be eligible.
This scheme has been authorised for a period of 4 years.</p>

aid was notified on the basis of Article 87(3)(d) of the EC Treaty, which
authorises aid to promote culture provided it does not adversely affect trading
conditions and competition.</p>
<p>The Commission opened an in-depth investigation into this measure so as to
ensure that it would not act as an industrial policy instrument in favour of the
video game sector (see <a
href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/1602&format=HTML&aged=1&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">IP/06/1602</a>).
It felt that the selection criteria in the initial notification could have given
rise to a wide interpretation that would not have made it possible to ensure
that the aid was exclusively dedicated to cultural goals, and it seemed that
categories such as pure simulation video games could benefit. Another purpose of
this investigation was to assess the impact of the aid on competition and on
other European video game companies.</p>
<p>As a result of this investigation, the French authorities were asked to
redefine and clarify the selection criteria. The Commission believes that the
new, more detailed selection test makes it possible to ensure that only video
games with cultural content may benefit from the aid.</p>
<p>Given in particular the small market shares of the manufacturers covered by
the measure, the Commission is satisfied that the aid will have a limited effect
on competition and on trade between the Member States. This effect will be even
more limited by the fact that the French authorities have accepted the
Commission’s request to largely include subcontracting costs within the
eligible costs. These costs had initially been excluded, thus creating the risk
that beneficiary companies would be encouraged to internalise their costs, to
the detriment of European subcontractors.</p>
<p>The non-confidential version of the decision will be made available under
case number C 47 / 2006 in the State Aid Register on the DG Competition website
once any confidentiality issues have been resolved. New publications of state
aid decisions in the Official Journal and on the website are listed in
“State Aid Weekly e-News”.</p>
