<P><B>Intergovernmental Conference: Commission proposes creating a European Prosecutor to combat fraud effectively</B></H3>
<P><I><B>As announced in its opinion of 26 January 2000, the Commission has drawn up and today adopted a concrete proposal for the creation of a European Prosecutor to protect the Communities</B></I><I><B>' financial interests (DOC/00/27). It will send the proposal to the Intergovernmental Conference as an additional contribution. The Commission</B></I><I><B>'s proposal is for a new Treaty article simply laying down the terms governing the appointment and departure from office of the independent prosecutor and defining his task. It suggests that his status and working arrangements be dealt with by secondary legislation. The proposal underlines the political priority which the Commission attaches to the fight against fraud and also offers a response to the concerns expressed by the European Parliament in its resolution on the IGC on 14 April.</B></I>
<P>Mrs Michaele Schreyer, the Commissioner responsible for budgets and combating fraud, stressed the point that:
<P>"Both the spirit and timing of the proposal are important. The traditional methods of judicial cooperation are no longer appropriate or adequate for the task of effectively combating fraud against the financial interests of the Community. Enlargement will increase the fragmentation of jurisdiction and the number of agencies involved in managing Community funds. If we want to maintain effective protection of the Community's financial interests tomorrow, we need to propose creating a European Prosecutor today."
<P>Michel Barnier, Commissioner in charge of regional policy and institutional reforms, who will present the proposal to the Intergovernmental Conference on behalf of the Commission, said:
<P>"We have not yet had any substantive discussion in the IGC about the creation of an office of prosecutor, although some delegations prefer to wait before embarking on this kind of reform, on the grounds that the changes brought in by the Treaty of Amsterdam have not yet borne full fruit. But in our view, progress towards stepping up the fight against fraud affecting the Communities' interests is moving too slowly. We think this proposal needs to be submitted right away."
<P>The proposal is strictly confined to protecting <B>the financial interests of the Community</B> as defined by Article 280 of the Treaty. It is in line with the thinking underlying the Treaty of Amsterdam, which for the first time made the Community and the Member States jointly responsible for protecting the Community's financial interests.
<P>In the Commission's view, creating a European Prosecutor is essential to ensure that fraud to the detriment of the Community is effectively prosecuted. Faced with the alarming increase in organised crime and cross-border fraud and the complexity of such cases, the traditional legal instruments are no longer enough. And although the creation of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) has made it possible to conduct EU-wide investigations into cases affecting the Community's financial interests, prosecutions based on the evidence uncovered are still hampered by the continuing limitations of judicial cooperation between the Member States.
<P>The new prosecutor would be in charge of investigations into cases affecting the Community's interests and prosecutions <B>in the national courts</B>. So he would not be taking the place of the national courts, least of all in terms of delivering a verdict. But he would make their task easier by presenting evidence obtained across the entire Union, helping them to overcome the obstacles posed by the fragmentation of jurisdiction among 15 (and soon more) Member States, each with their own rules and procedures.
<P>The Commission proposes incorporating only the basic rules governing the prosecutor in the Treaty (appointment, departure from office, task, independence). The Treaty would provide for secondary legislation to define the precise working arrangements, in particular the rules on procedure, offences covered and penalties incurred.
