<P><B>Commission adopts a proposal on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The  European Commission has adopted a proposal for a Council Directive on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status. The aim of this measure  is to introduce a minimum level playing field in the European Community in the short term. For this purpose, it introduces both guarantees for a fair procedure and mechanisms and tools for an efficient procedure. As a package, it is an essential first measure on asylum procedures in Member States (Based on Article 63(1)(d) of the EC Treaty).</B></I>
<P>It is the first Community measure on asylum procedures. It consists of minimum standards and does not  require Member States to apply uniform procedures. Member States retain their national systems, provided they accept certain standards and requirements with respect to the competent authorities and the relevant procedures. For instance, the proposal permits Member States to choose the nature of the body that reviews the decisions that are taken in first instance. It can be either a judicial or administrative body.  It is a first measure also in the sense that it leaves Member States the choice whether or not to apply these standards in procedures for subsidiary protection of persons found not to be refugees. 
<P>Asylum procedures should not be so long and drawn out that persons in need of protection have to go through a long period of uncertainty before their cases are decided, and persons who have no need of protection, but wish to remain on the territory of the Member States, see an application for asylum as a means of prolonging their stay. For this purpose, it is proposed that a simple and quick system for asylum procedures in Member States consists of no more than a single appeal or review of the decision (as mentioned above, either by an administrative or a judicial body), and the possibility of further appeal to an « Appellate Court ».
<P>According to the proposal, Member States are at liberty to decide whether or not to introduce  specific procedures for inadmissible and manifestly unfounded cases, but if they do, they should abide by the common standards that are laid down in the provisions. These procedures provide inter alia for deciding on so called « safe third country » and « safe country of origin » cases. In addition, Member States can retain or introduce a « border procedure »  for such cases if they follow the standards in the proposal. This kind of procedure is already in place in several Member States : it is a procedure in which applicants are refused entry to the territory because their case is undeserving.
<P>It is in order to help Member States swiftly process asylum applications and recognize applicants that are in need of protection in accordance with the Geneva Convention, that provision has been made for Member States to operate these specific procedures for inadmissible and manifestly unfounded<B> </B>cases. Common standards for these procedures shall also help avoid secondary movements of asylum applicants between Member States.
<P>In order to correctly identify those in need of protection in accordance with the Geneva Convention, the proposal introduces minimum procedural guarantees. A common level of procedural fairness is thus established in the national systems of the Member States, which may also help avoid secondary movements. Guarantees proposed include a right to a personal interview, the opportunity to contact organisations or persons that provide legal assistance and the right to appeal from a decision.
<P>Finally, the proposal introduces additional specific procedural guarantees for persons with special needs, including unaccompanied minors. These include that a legal guardian or adviser must be appointed to assist and represent an unaccompanied minor with respect to the examination of his application.
<P><I>Background information </I>
<P>This proposal is the first instrument for a common European asylum system that the Commission brings forward. At the European Council in Tampere in October 1999, the Member States agreed to the introduction in the short term of a common European asylum system, which would include « a clear and workable determination of the State responsible for the examination of the asylum application, common standards for a fair and efficient asylum procedure, common minimum conditions of reception of asylum seekers, and the approximation of rules on the recognition and content of the refugee status. It should also be completed with measures on subsidiary forms of protection offering an appropriate status to any person in need of such protection ».   Proposals or measures for these standards will follow before September 2001.
<P>The proposal is based upon discussions in the Council and the European Parliament following the March 1999 Commission working document 'towards common standards in asylum procedures'. The European Parliament adopted a resolution in June this year. Member States have commented on the working document and relevant organisations, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, have submitted written replies. 
<P>A Communication on asylum procedures shall outline the possible next steps that could go further and lead to a common asylum procedure for the Community in the long term. Such a Communication has been requested by the European Council of Tampere and will be brought forward by the Commission by the end of this year.
