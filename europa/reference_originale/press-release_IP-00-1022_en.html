<P><B>Commission clarifies its policy on services of general interest</B></H3>
<P><I><B>In a Communication adopted today, the European Commission has given further clarification of its policy on services of general interest. The Communication has been issued in response to the request made by the European Council in Lisbon and repeated at Feira to update a first Communication issued on the matter in 1996. The rapid development of markets and technology are a source of concern for the public about the future of these services and also generate the need for further clarification for operators about the application of the rules of the Treaty to these services, in particular the Internal Market and competition rules.</B></I>

<P>The first Communication, adopted in 1996 (see IP/96/824), marked an important step in the Commission's recognition of the role of economic services of general interest as a key aspect of the European model of society. The Commission called for a reference to them to be inserted in the Treaty. This was done in the Treaty of Amsterdam. Services of general interest are now explicitly recognised in the EC Treaty (Article 16) as belonging to "the shared values of the Union" and are seen as having "a role in promoting economic and social cohesion".
<P>The new Communication begins by restating that responsibility for defining and organising services of general interest lies primarily with the public authorities in the Member States. Their action must satisfy the requirement for openness. The objective must be to serve the best interests of the public by offering access to high quality services at affordable prices. This is also the purpose of Community policies for developing the Internal Market and protecting competition. These policies are therefore in no way in conflict with a policy on services of general interest. Indeed they are complementary instruments which must interact for the benefit of the whole of society.
<P>The great diversity of national contexts and of the sectors involved produces great diversity in the organisation of the services too. In some cases the market by itself may not guarantee satisfactory provision, for instance adequate territorial cover. It is then necessary to impose on certain operators specific missions of general interest. The operators undertaking these missions are entitled to special or exclusive rights or to financing mechanisms designed to ensure that they can maintain a financial balance in performing them.
<P>The Communication clarifies, mainly for the benefit of these operators and the public authorities they come under, the criteria for the application of the rules of the Treaty. It first clarifies their scope: only activities of an economic nature which are traded between Member States are concerned. A great many purely local or social activities are not therefore caught by the rules.
<P>The Commission also points out that the Treaty guarantees performance of the services of general interest by the operators responsible for their management. It is neutral in relation to the public or private ownership of these operators. It leaves Member States the freedom to define what they consider to be services of general interest. But it does set a test of proportionality: if restrictions are placed on the application of the Internal Market or competition rules, they must not exceed what is required for fulfilment of the mission of general economic interest.
<P>The Community conducts a pro-active policy for services of general interest. The liberalisation of some large sectors, in particular those whose network structure gives them a natural Community dimension (telecommunications, postal services, energy and transport), is a gradual process, based on assessments of their impact and on wide-ranging consultation of all the actors involved. In each case, depending on the specific features of each sector, the universal service obligations which accompany the opening up of the market guarantee the provision of even higher quality services to consumers.
<P>The Community's pro-active policy is evident not only in the deepening of the Internal Market. Other instruments are used, in particular the consumer protection policy and the defence in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) of the maintenance of services of general interest in Europe.
