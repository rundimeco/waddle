<P><B>Commission clears acquisition of Mallinckrodt by Tyco</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has approved the acquisition of US healthcare company Mallinckrodt, by Bermuda-registered Tyco International. The only  overlap in the companies</B></I><I><B>' activities occurs in the field of medical devices, but their overall market share does not raise any competition concerns. </B></I>
<P>Tyco is a diversified manufacturing and service company, active in several business sectors, including disposable medical supplies. Mallinckrodt is a global healthcare company active especially in diagnostic imaging, pharmaceuticals and respiratory care. 
<P>The acquisition will not result in a distortion of competition. An overlap between the parties' activities only occurs in the field of medical devices, such as airway (endotracheal) tubes. As supported by the market investigation carried out by the Commission, the geographic market for these products appears to be EEA-wide. This is due to factors such as the lack of regulatory barriers at national level and the use of EEA-wide tendering procedures by hospitals. The increase in market shares brought by the transaction is relatively small and the parties' combined market shares in the affected markets are not sufficiently high to indicate ability to exercise market power. 
<P>The existence of a number of strong competitors in each of the affected markets ensures competition and the transaction does not change the competitive situation significantly. As regards the medical devices sector in general, after the acquisition of Mallinckrodt, Tyco will be the third largest supplier in Europe after Johnson & Johnson and Baxter. The degree of competition in the hospital market with sophisticated buyers and falling prices for medical devices has also been taken into account in the analysis of this case.  
<P>Due to the above factors, the Commission has decided to approve the transaction and to declare it compatible with the common market.
