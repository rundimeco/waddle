<P><B>CSFP: Commission acts swiftly to improve security of Georgian borders</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The EU has responded swiftly to a request from President Eduard Shevardnadze of Georgia for a contribution to ensure the protection of its borders, and to improve protection from terrorists threats, in particular against the OSCE Observer Mission on the Georgian border with the Chechen Republic of the Russian Federation.  The Council of Ministers in July</B></I><sup><a name="file.tmp_Ref_1"><a href="#file.tmp_Foot_1">(1)</a></a></sup><I><B> decided that the EU should provide aid to the Government of Georgia in the form of equipment to be delivered to border posts by 30 September 2000.  This week the European Commission delivered military grade equipment and aviation fuel, worth </B></I><I><B>€1 million, in Tbilisi. This assistance will allow the equipment of 100 personnel at three Georgian border posts to carry out protection duties, patrolling and long-term flying of the Border Guards helicopters.  It also increases the ability of the Border Guards to sustain a winter presence at the border. The provision of this aid, under the authority of External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten, demonstrates the importance the European Union accords to the security of Georgia and the integrity of its borders by preventing the spill-over of the conflict in the Chechen Republic. </B></I>
<P>On 10 April 2000 the President of Georgia requested the assistance of the European Union to ensure the protection of its borders and in particular to improve protection against threats to the OSCE Observer Mission on the Georgian border with the Chechen Republic of the Russian Federation.  This Observer Mission contributes to the stability of the region by providing detailed information on the traffic and events around the border in order to diffuse possible tensions.  In June 2000 an assessment mission, carried out by General Sir Garry Johnson acting as a representative of the European Union , concluded that there was a clear need for equipment to permit the Georgian Border Guards to perform their duties effectively, notably in protecting the OSCE Observer Mission.
<P>A specially chartered plane, carrying 25 tons of equipment, ranging from field rations and medical packs, camouflage uniforms, tents and field shower units,radios and batteries to mine-detecting equipment arrived in Tblissi on 15 September .   The strict observance of this delivery date (laid down as a condition in the Joint Action ) was primordial as climatic conditions, high mountain country, ice snow and freezing temperatures make movement almost impossible in most of the region from early Autumn to late Spring.  Local purchases included 10 four-wheel drive vehicles, fuel and lubricants for helicopters, aviation fuel and generators. The whole process, including the Commission Decision of 02 August 2000, commitments, contracts, payments and transportation of goods took less than one month.  
<P>The action was co-ordinated by the Commission Delegation in Georgia which was entrusted with acquiring the local equipment and fuel, the supervision of the delivery and use of all the materials including those delivered from Europe to the Georgian authorities, as well as their effective and timely transportation by those authorities to the border posts concerned.  The total cost of the exercise amounts to €1 million.<p><sup><a name="file.tmp_Foot_1"><a href="#file.tmp_Ref_1">(1)</a></a></sup><SUP><I> Council Joint Action of 20 July 2000, O.J.
