<a name="Heading5"></a><b>Albania joins EU innovation &amp;
competitiveness programme</b></h1>
<h2>
<a name="Heading8"></a><b><i>Albania is the fifth country of the group of EU
candidate and potential candidate countries to join an important part of the
EU's Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP) Under the CIP, the European
Commission promotes innovation, entrepreneurship and growth in small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Today, European Commission Vice President
Günter Verheugen and Mr Genc Ruli, Minister for Economy, Trade and Energy
of the Republic of Albania, signed a Memorandum of Understanding formalising the
Republic’s entry to the EIP, the entrepreneurship and innovation pillar of
the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP).</i></b></h2>
<p>Commission Vice-President Günter Verheugen, responsible for enterprise
and industry policy said: “We are creating a win-win situation for Albania
and for the EU. The decision of Albania to join the CIP confirms the European
aspirations of Albania and the progress already achieved. We also share the
understanding that the challenges of today's global world are best faced by
integration and ever closer co-operation.”</p>
<p>Albania will be able to take part in the framework of the European Charter
for Small Enterprises by making direct ties with EU Member States and learning
from good practice in promoting entrepreneurship and innovation in all its
various forms. This will strengthen Albania's own policy and delivery capability
for the benefit of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs). Albanian policy
stakeholders and experts can now join the relevant policy groups which the
European Commission will set up under CIP to assist to develop an SME friendly
policy, which is key to achieve sustainable growth and more and better
employment opportunities. It is another step to bring Albania, which has an EU
Membership perspective closer to the EU. It will benefit Albanian SMEs as it
will benefit those SMEs from the EU with business ties to Albania, to develop
together. </p>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>The backbone of the Albanian economy is formed by the large and expanding
sector of small companies. The groundwork on developing a favourable regulatory
framework for SME’s has made substantial progress through Albania’s
participation, since 2003, in the European Charter for Small Enterprises
process. </p>
<p>The following EU candidate and potential candidate countries have already
joined the CIP:</p>
<p>Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in October 2007,
followed by Turkey in February 2008 and by Montenegro in March 2008.</p>
<p><b>Background information:</b><br>The CIP programme, which runs from 2007 to
2013 with a budget of € 3.6 billion, contains the following 3 pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Entrepreneurship and Innovation Framework Programme (EIP)</b>: EIP
fosters the competitiveness of enterprises for example by providing
co-guarantees and co-investments for local banks and risk capital funds so that
they can improve access for SMEs to loan and venture capital finance. EIP also
supports providers of business and innovation services in all EU regions or
helps to link innovation actors and clusters in European networks.</li>
<li><b>Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme
(ICTPSP)</b>: ICTPSP accelerates the development of a sustainable, competitive,
innovative and inclusive Information Society<b> </b>stimulating a wider adoption
and more efficient take up and better use of ICT. </li>
<li><b>Intelligent Energy-Europe Programme (IEE)</b>: IEE promotes energy
efficiency and new and renewable energy sources in all sectors including
transport.</li></ul><p>A long-term view demands that the Commission works very
closely with all candidate and potential candidate countries. </p>
