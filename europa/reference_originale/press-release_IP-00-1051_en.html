<P><B>Commission clears Deutsche Bank and Enel acquisition of joint control over Rio Nuovo</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has authorised the operation by which Deutsche Bank and SEI, the real estate managing entity of Italy</B></I><I><B>'s Enel, acquire joint control of a newly constituted joint venture: Rio Nuovo. Rio nuovo will be active in the Italian real estate market for offices where it will have very low market shares since SEI committed to transfer to it only a small portion of its office real estate business. Deutsche Bank has never been active in the Italian real estate market. The operation will therefore have no appreciable competitive impact on the market structure. </B></I>
<P>Sei S.p.a. (SEI) is the Italian real estate managing entity of Enel Holding SpA (Enel) to which it provides real estate management and facility management services. Enel is the principal electricity company in Italy, and is involved in the generation, transmission, distribution and supply of electricity. As a result of the notified operation Deutsche Bank, through its wholly-owned subsidiary REIB International Holdings Limited (REIB) and SEI will acquire joint control of Rio Nuovo S.p.a. (RIO) by way of purchase of shares in a newly created company constituting a joint venture.
<P>The notified operation involves the real estate market in Italy, and in particular, the market for owning, maintaining, operating and letting real estate for offices. According to previous Commission decisions, the real estate market may in fact be subdivided into two smaller markets: properties for residential use (housing), and properties for commercial use (offices, shops and industrial properties). RIO will operate in the market for offices in a few Italian regions and municipalities where SEI has very low market shares (below 1%). Although DB, through a few recent concentrations, has entered the market of real estate within some EU member states, it is not active in the Italian market, nor are any of its controlled entities. Therefore, as regards horizontal relationships, the parties are not engaged in overlapping activities.
