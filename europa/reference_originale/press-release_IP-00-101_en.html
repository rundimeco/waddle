<P><B>Commission investigates State aid Dutch manure processing companies</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The Commission has decided to open a formal investigation to state aid paid  manure processing companies in the Netherlands beyond the validity of the approved aid scheme for this sector, </B></I><I><B>"Bijdrageregeling Proefprojecten Mestverwerking</B></I><I><B>" (</B></I><I><B>"BPM-scheme</B></I><I><B>"). The aid threatens to distort competition in fertiliser production and to favour the animal husbandry sector by creating outlets for surplus manure without this sector paying all the costs.</B></I>
<P>By decision of 6 July 1989, the Commission approved the "BPM-scheme" for one year only. In<I> </I>1990, the Commission approved an extension of the scheme, in order to include larger projects, until 1994. The scheme provided for investment aid of up to 35 % of the overall investment cost for test installations and factories for manure processing with new features in order to stimulate the creation of useful outlets for the manure surplus in the Netherlands. The budget for the year 1989/90 amounted to € 21,8 million. The budget for the extended period 1990-1994 totalled  € 63,45 million. 
<P>Since 1994 various complaints drew the Commission´s attention to cases of aid granted to manure processing projects under the "BPM-scheme". The complainants alleged that aid had been awarded before and after the period for which the Commission had approved the scheme. By decision of 17 July 1999, the Commission enjoined the Netherlands to provide all information necessary for the examination if the aid granted could be subsumed under the "BPM-scheme" and to disclose if any other aid has been paid out. According to the information provided by the Dutch government, the Commission deduces that in six cases aid amounting € 2 501 089 has been awarded after 31 December 1994, the date of expiry of the scheme, whereas in four cases aid totalling € 3 325 084 has been granted in 1988, thus, before its coming into force.
<P>Since this aid was not covered by any approved scheme, it required individual notification. The Dutch authorities failed to comply with this obligation. 
<P>The investment aid granted by the Dutch government was designed to initiate and enable investment for pilot projects and hence favoured the manure processing factories concerned. By strengthening their financial position, the cash incentive threatens to distort competition in the internal EU-market, as manure, used as a fertiliser, competes with other organic fertilisers. Dutch exports of processed animal manure to other Member States can be expected to increase markedly as a consequence of the above mentioned projects.
<P>The aid also favours the animal husbandry sector, by creating outlets for surplus manure, without this sector paying all the cost thereof. Consequently, the aid is likely to distort competition between Member States also in that sector and constitutes State aid in the sense of Article 87 (1) EC Treaty.
<P>The Commission approved the extension of the "BPM-scheme" in 1990 as an exception in order to allow the Dutch government to give an incentive for the introduction of an innovative technology. The successful outcome of these projects depended on the willingness of the farmers to pay for the processing of manure produced by their farms.  On that occasion, the Commission already pointed out that if these projects turned out not to be viable, it has an a priori negative attitude towards further manure aid in the Netherlands.
<P>As to the compatibility of the aid paid out to the four projects before 1989 the Commission considers that they fulfilled all the conditions laid down in the "BPM-scheme". Consequently, they complied with it in substance. If the Dutch government had complied with the formal notification requirement of Article 87 EC Treaty, the Commission would have approved these cases at that time, as it had a positive approach to such projects which led to the positive decision in 1989. Furthermore, the Dutch authorities could have legally awarded the aid under the "BPM-scheme" one year later. Therefore, the Commission considers the aid in these cases to be compatible with the EC Treaty.
<P>In the six cases in which aid has been paid out after the expiry of the scheme, it appears that the subsidies do not conform with the principles laid down in the guidelines concerning environmental aid as manure processing factories seem to be dependent on continuous aid to sustain the maintenance of their production. The serious doubts as to the compliance of these six aid measures with Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty could not be dispelled and the Commission therefore decided to open the formal procedure laid down in Article 88 (2) EC Treaty concerning all cases of aid awarded after the expiry of the "BPM-scheme".
