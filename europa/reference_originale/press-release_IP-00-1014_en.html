<P><B>Triumph's export ban for motorcycles brought to an end upon Commission's intervention</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has decided to end its antitrust action against the motorcycle manufacturer Triumph after the company stopped prohibiting its Benelux dealers to sell to UK customers. Following a number of letters from British customers claiming that they were not able to purchase Triumph's motorcycles in the Netherlands and Belgium, the Commission carried out a </B></I><I><B>"dawn raid</B></I><I><B>" at the premises of Triumph in the UK, its Benelux importer and a number of dealers in the above-mentioned countries in April 1999. Evidence of an export prohibition was indeed found. Later Triumph acknowledged the facts for the period from April 1997 until March 1998 and offered to co-operate with the Commission. By its action the Commission sends a clear message to the motorcycle manufacturers that it will act against similar infringements should they occur and sanction them where appropriate.</B></I>
<P>Triumph is a manufacturer of motorcycles of large engine capacity (750cc and over). Its motorcycles are sold in all Member States of the European Union (EU). Triumph's market share for this kind of motorcycle in the entire Union is below 5%. Market shares in individual Member States are also below 5% except in the United Kingdom where it oscillates around 10%. Motorcycle distribution is not covered by the block exemption granted by Regulation 1475/95 which concerns only the selective and exclusive distribution system for cars, trucks and buses.
<P>Following the reception of the British customers' letters the Commission started an inquiry on its own initiative to investigate the existence of the alleged export prohibition from Belgium and the Netherlands to the United Kingdom. For that purpose, surprise inspections were carried out at Triumph's, at Greenib's premises, the Benelux importer, and at a number of dealers in Belgium and the Netherlands.
<P>The Commission found evidence proving that Greenib urged its Benelux dealers to stop export sales of Triumph motorcycles. Documents found at the premises of the Belgian and Dutch dealers confirmed such instruction.
<P>Three months after the inspections, Triumph admitted having imposed an export prohibition via Greenib on its Benelux dealers from April/May 1997 to March 1998 to prevent its dealers from selling to UK customers. According to Triumph, the action to reduce parallel trade was a result of the currency fluctuations between the sterling and other currencies. Price differences between the UK and Belgium and the Netherlands reached 30% for certain models at the time.
<P>At the Commission's request in view to ensure that the action does not re-occur Triumph communicated to Greenib, its UK dealers and the dealers in Belgium and the Netherlands that all dealers are free to sell motorcycles to any customer irrespective of that customer's country of origin or where the motorcycle is to be used.
<P>An export prohibition constitutes one of the most severe restriction of competition contrary to Article 81 of the Treaty. However, given the limited period of time during which the ban was applied, the limited impact that it was able to produce on the market, and given that Triumph has acknowledged the facts, has taken appropriate measures to cease the export ban, and has implemented all the requested measures asked for by the Commission to inform dealers of their obligations, the Commission considers that it is not necessary in the present circumstances to pursue further the case.
