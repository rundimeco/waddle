<P><B>Commissioner Nielson to visit the Horn of Africa from 3 to 9 October</B></H3>
<P><I><B>Mr Poul Nielson, European Commissioner for Development Co-operation and Humanitarian Aid will undertake a mission to the Horn of Africa from 3 to 9 October. Mr Nielson will use this visit to gather first hand information about the impact and need of EU aid in particular in the context of increased humanitarian needs due to conflict and drought. He will visit Kenya on 3-4 October, Ethiopia on 5-6 October, Djibouti on 7 October and Eritrea 8-9 October. As well as assessing for himself the situation in the region, Mr Nielson will seek to raise public awareness of the efforts undertaken by the European Commission in providing support by means of humanitarian aid, food aid and development co-operation. In this context, he will stress the importance of a coherent food security policy as the most promising way out of a situation of structural food deficit.</B></I>
<P>Much of the mission will consist of field trips to areas where the Commission has funded and is funding humanitarian activities. Mr Nielson will meet with public authorities, non-governmental organisations and other partners (including UN agencies) together with local populations. Questions of development co-operation as well as humanitarian problems will be discussed in a series of high level meetings with decision-makers in the four countries, including President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia, President Ismaël Omar Guelleh of Djibouti and President Issaias Afwerki of Eritrea.
<P>In <B>Kenya </B>where a significant part of the population is currently suffering from an extended drought, Mr Nielson will assess the critical food situation. The EU is contributing 45 000 metric tonnes of cereal to the country this year and has so far provided €2 million in humanitarian aid with more foreseen.
<P>In <B>Ethiopia</B>, Mr Nielson will pay a visit to the Somali region, the part of Ethiopia hardest hit by drought. With 432,000 t of food aid already delivered or about to arrive in Ethiopia before the end of this year, the Commission has played a major role among the international donors in addressing the humanitarian needs caused by three consecutive years of insufficient rains. In addition to the provision of food aid the Commission, since the beginning of this year, has made available some €9 million in humanitarian aid in favour of the drought affected population and €3.5 million in favour of vulnerable populations displaced by the conflict with Eritrea.
<P>In his meeting with the President of <B>Djibout</B>i, the Commissioner will also express the appreciation by the Commission of the efforts successfully deployed by the President and supported by the whole population of Djibouti in favour of the reestablishment of peace and governance in Somalia, a country without a national government for the last ten years.
<P>In <B>Eritrea,</B> besides discussing the objective of reinforcing development co-operation, Mr Nielson will see for himself the humanitarian situation of the populations. He plans to visit IDP (internally displaced persons) camps and a planned rehabilitation project. In response to the humanitarian repercussions of the military conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia, the Commission has already earmarked, this year, humanitarian aid worth €5.6 million  for relief activities. This has come on top of 76 000 metric tonnes of cereals and 10 000 metric tonnes of other food aid already delivered or scheduled to arrive in Eritrea this year.
<P>In all of the four countries Mr Nielson will have regular contacts with the media where humanitarian and development issues as well as political topics will be raised
