<P><B>Commission opens investigation procedure on State aid granted by France to Mines et Potasses d</B><B>'Alsace</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has opened a formal investigation procedure on State aid granted by France, through the public holding EMC (Entreprise Miniere et Chimique), to Mines et Potasses d</B></I><I><B>'Alsace (MDPA). The Commission found that France, through EMC, granted to MDPA State aid in excess to what it had previously authorised in 1996 for the period 1995-1997. Moreover, the Commission has serious doubts regarding the compatibility of the new aid measures notified by the French authorities for the period 1998-2000. </B></I>
<P>MDPA is a mining company producing potash in the Alsace Region, 100% controlled by the public holding EMC. The company has faced a declining turnover and increasing losses since the end of the 1980s, as a consequence of the declining market in potash.
<P>In 1994, MDPA decided to close all its production sites. After negotiations with the Unions, it was decided in 1997 to gradually reduce production levels until a complete closure of all plants in 2004. At that time, MDPA had 2 675 employees and a market share in Europe of about 13%.
<P>In 1994, the Commission had approved a Ffr 500 million (€ 76 million)  State aid to be granted to MDPA through the public holding EMC, as covering the extra social costs incurred by MDPA related with the "Statut du Mineur" (specific social charges of the mining sector). For the same reasons, in April 1996, the Commission approved three new capital increases to EMC of Ffr 250 million (€ 38 million) each over the period 1995-1997, to be transferred by EMC to MDPA. 
<P>On 7 December 1998, the French authorities notified three new capital increases of Ffr 275 million (€ 42 million) each to be granted by the State to EMC in each year from 1998 to 2000. During the examination of these measures, the Commission discovered that MDPA received from EMC, over the period 1995-1997, an amount of State aid exceeding by Ffr 1 280 million (€ 195 million) that approved by the 1996 decision, without that additional amount having obtained prior approval of the Commission.
<P>Moreover, it found that over the period 1998-2000 MDPA was to receive an amount of aid much higher than what notified. In particular, EMC already granted to MDPA Ffr 1320 million (€ 201 million) in 1998 and 1999, without waiting for the approval of the Commission. 
<P>In addition, since 1998 the majority of the social charges is no longer borne by MDPA, but are instead being paid directly by EMC. MDPA only had to cover            Ffr 51 million (€ 7.8 miilion) in 1997, 36 million ( € 5.5 million) in 1998, 16 million (€ 2.5 million) in 1999 and 13 million ( € 2 million) in 2000, the rest being paid by EMC.
<P>The Commission, at this stage, has doubts that the reasoning followed in its previous decisions can be applied, as the notified measures, as well as the extra amount granted by the State through EMC to MDPA over the period 1995-1997, seem not aimed at compensating any such social charges. Therefore, it decided to open the Article 88(3) procedure in respect of the above described measures.
