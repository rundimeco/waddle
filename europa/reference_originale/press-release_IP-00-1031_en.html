<P><B>Commission adopts Communication on the Fight against HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has adopted a new Communication on </B></I><I><B>"Accelerated action targeted at major communicable diseases within the context of poverty reduction</B></I><I><B>". The Communication sets out the policy framework which the Commission will use to improve its response to the increasing spread and growing impact of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in the developing world. This Communication proposes a coherent set of development, trade and research policies to combat these diseases. </B></I>
<P><I>"Last April the Commission adopted a new Development Policy for the European Union ( EU) with two major objectives - poverty reduction and greater coherence and synergy between development and other EU policies,</I><I>"</I> said Commissioner Poul Nielson.  <I>"This Communication is an important element of this fresh approach to our development work. Whilst continuing our support for national health systems, the Commission will seek to improve the </I><I><U>impact</U></I><I> of existing strategies and technologies to protect the poor from infection with these diseases, improve the </I><I><U>affordability</U></I><I> of diagnosis and care for people who are sick, and increase investments in </I><I><U>research</U></I><I> to find long term solutions to disease, such as vaccines to prevent malaria and AIDS</I>".
<P>Epidemics of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are now out of control in many developing countries, killing over 5 million people every year and causing over 300 million episodes of illness. 34 million people are already infected with HIV, and some estimates suggest that that by 2010, 30 million people a year could be dying from AIDS. 13.2 million children have already been orphaned by the disease. Skilled workers are being lost by the thousand in the worst affected countries of Africa. National economies are being badly affected too; Kenya's GDP is already 10% less than it would have been without AIDS, and continues to decline by 1% a year. 
<P><I>"The goal of the accelerated programme is to reduce the health and economic impacts of these three diseases and help millions of families in the developing world break the cycle of poverty and ill-health</I>", said Mr. Nielson. "<I>I am committed to reforming the way we deliver on our policies so that </I><I>"accelerated</I><I>" means just that -  we will act more quickly, decisively and effectively in helping to overcome what is rapidly becoming a public health catastrophe in many developing countries</I>."
<P>Mr Nielson also announced that the Commission will host a high level international Round Table on 28 September to discuss the EU's policy to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis and reduce poverty. Representatives from some 40 developing countries, leaders of industry, research agencies and NGOs, will consult with the Commission to steer the development of a programme of action for the implementation of the Communication. The Round Table is being co-sponsored by the World Health Organisation and the United Nations' Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS.
