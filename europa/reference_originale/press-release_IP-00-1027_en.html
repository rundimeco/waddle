<P><B>Commission approves State aid in connection with electricity reform in Denmark </B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission today approved the State aid measures that are part of the electricity reform in Denmark. The purpose of the reform is not only to fully transpose the Directive on common rules for the internal market in electricity, but also to combine the consideration for increased competition with Denmark</B></I><I><B>'s international environmental commitments. The new system will lead to a situation where 20% of the electricity consumed domestically will be based on renewable energy sources in 2003. The tool used to obtain this goal is a so-called </B></I><I><B>"green certificate</B></I><I><B>"-system.</B></I>
<P>So far the Danish producers of electricity using renewable energy sources have benefited from a system with fixed prices and direct State subsidies. Once the new system has been phased in fully, all electricity will be sold at the market price. The compensation to producers of "green electricity", whose production costs are higher, will instead be taken care of by a system of green certificates. 
<P>All producers of "green electricity" established in Denmark, existing as well as new entrants, will be allocated green certificates in relation to their electricity production. They are subsequently to sell these certificates to consumers, who will be obliged to buy a number of green certificates corresponding to a certain share of their electricity consumption, fixed on an annual basis. As the overall objective is for 20% of electricity consumption to be covered by "green electricity" by the end of 2003, the purchase obligation will increase year by year until it has reached that level. A consumer who does not fulfil the obligation has to pay a fine of DKK 0.27/kWh to the State. The State will then come in and buy the excess certificates through a public fund financed from the fines. 
<P>The certificates will be sold on a market that is separate from the electricity market. In principle prices will be established freely, but the Danish authorities have set a fixed price range of DKK 0.100.27/kWh. On the one hand, this guarantees producers a minimum compensation in addition to the market price for electricity and, on the other hand, it limits the burden on electricity consumers. The authorities have not yet determined whether all trade in green certificates will take place at a central exchange, or whether some trade may also take place on a bilateral basis. 
<P>The system contains an elment of State intervention to the benefit of producers of « green electricity » and so an assesment under the State aid rules was necessary.
<P>The benefit of the green certificate system as compared to a system with fixed prices and direct State subsidies is that it contains an incentive for producers to reduce their production costs. As consumers strive to fulfil their purchase obligation at the lowest possible cost, those producers that are able to manage with a lower top-up on the electricity price will be able to sell more easily.
