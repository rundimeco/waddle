<P><B>Environmental fuel standards: Commission moves against Germany and Italy</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has decided to issue Reasoned Opinions (second warning letters) against Germany and Italy for their failure to send to the Commission national legislation to give effect to the 1999 Directive setting environmental standards for petrol and diesel fuels. The deadline for implementing this Directive into national law was the 1 July 1999. The Commission already sent letters of formal notice (first warning letters) to the two Member States in November 1999, and as both failed to reply the Commission has decided to press on with the cases. </B></I>
<P>The Fuel Standards Directive (European Parliament and Council Directive 98/70/EC relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels and amending Council Directive 93/12/EEC) sets technical specifications on health and environmental grounds for fuels to be used for vehicles equipped with positive-ignition and compression-ignition engines. The Directive introduces, amongst other things, a prohibition on the marketing of leaded petrol and sets standards for diesel fuel. At the end of 1999, the Commission granted Italy a derogation to continue the sale of leaded petrol until 1 January 2002 (see IP/99/999). This does not mean, however, that all the provisions of the Directive do not have to be transposed in the national legal system within the deadline set out in the directive. The provision concerned by the derogation granted by the Commission is also to be transposed within the normal deadline, although it shall indicate a different date for the introduction of the ban for leaded petrol.
