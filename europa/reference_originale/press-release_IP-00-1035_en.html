<P><B>Innovation gets more attention in Europe, but more efforts are needed if Europe is to become fully competitive, says Commission</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has adopted broad policy lines designed to enhance innovation in Europe. Innovation policy is an essential element of the agenda set at the Lisbon Summit in March. This Summit was the turning point in recognising the need to tackle the challenges of the New Economy by, for example, endorsing the Commission's eEurope action plan and launching a benchmarking exercise. </B></I><I><B>"There are reassuring signs that with an appropriate policy mix, Europe</B></I><I><B>'s economic performance can be upgraded. But more needs to be done if Europe is to become fully competitive.</B></I><I><B>" said Mr Erkki Liikanen, Commissioner responsible for Enterprise and the Information Society, elaborating on the newly published Communication "Innovation in a knowledge-driven economy". The Innovation Scoreboard set out in the Communication is the first concrete implementation of the benchmarking exercise called for in Lisbon. Its aim is to identify best practices in the Member States in innovation policies. The Commission</B></I><I><B>'s Communication recommends that Member States step up efforts to get rid of obstacles and rigidities and change attitudes which prevent full advantage being taken of the knowledge society.</B></I>
<P>Although many policies and measures aimed at encouraging innovation have been introduced in Member States and at European level during recent years, the Commission considers that the overall innovation performance of the EU still continues to lag behind its main competitors.
<P>According to the Commission, Member States should intensify their efforts to create a business environment that favours innovation. Mr Liikanen said "The trend to globalisation and the new knowledge-based economy means that enterprises either learn how to innovate, or they must expect to go under in the face of the competition. In the final analysis it is up to enterprises and entrepreneurs to pick up this challenge, but the public authorities have a responsibility to encourage our innovators and would-be innovators by providing the right background conditions."
<P>Nevertheless, in some Member States some of the innovation-related statistical indicators relevant to innovation performance have reached levels close to, or even better than, equivalent indicators for Europe's main competitors. This means there is scope for improving innovation performance by learning from "best practices" that already exist in the EU.
<P>The Communication<sup><a name="file.tmp_Ref_1"><a href="#file.tmp_Foot_1">(1)</a></a></sup> includes the first outline of the European Innovation Scoreboard requested by the European Council at the Lisbon Summit held in March 2000, using the statistics that are currently available. This is the first time an exercise of this type has been undertaken at European level. It allows the relative strengths and weaknesses of the innovation indicators in Member States to be assessed, and provides an overall picture of the EU's innovation performance.
<P>The Communication recommends that the Member States should:
<UL><P><LI>Improve their policies for encouraging innovative enterprises, in particular by building on "best practices" that have proved successful in other Member States,
<P><LI>Avoid that innovators are hampered by excessive "red tape". The Commission is of the opinion that special attention should be devoted to private investment in research and innovation, and that the rules governing use of results from publicly-funded research could be streamlined and improved, in order to become market-driven,
<P><LI>Provide a fertile environment for the creation and growth of innovative companies, by pursuing efforts to create favourable legal, fiscal and financial conditions for start-ups, by ensuring adequate support at regional level, and by fostering education and training in entrepreneurship and innovation management,
<P><LI>Encourage innovation to permeate the economic and social fabric, by improving the operation of key factors in innovation systems. The Commission specifically draws attention to the role of Research and Development and training institutions, in particularly universities and large public research facilities, and to the importance of regional initiatives to encourage and support innovators and would-be innovators.
<P><LI>Aim at a well-informed European society, by encouraging comprehensive debates on innovation between stakeholders, involving scientists, industry, consumers and public authorities.
</UL><P>The Commission intends to act as a catalyst to enhance Member State measures and policies. It will promote benchmarking of specific Member State innovation policies and performances, contribute to the identification and dissemination of "best practices", and will continue to publish the European Innovation Scoreboard at regular intervals. It will monitor progress in improving the legal and regulatory environment to make it more favourable for innovation, for example by reducing "red tape".
<P>Networking and the provision of advisory and support services on a European scale will be encouraged by the Commission, especially transnational cooperation among regions with a view to exchange good practices in fostering innovation and to facilitate transnational technology partnerships.<p><sup><a name="file.tmp_Foot_1"><a href="#file.tmp_Ref_1">(1)</a></a></sup><SUP><B> Commission Communication </B></SUP><SUP><B>Innovation in a knowledge-driven economy</B></SUP>
