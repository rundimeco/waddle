<P><B>Commission clears way for Alstom</B><B>'s takeover of Fiat Ferroviaria</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has decided to authorise the acquisition of Fiat Ferroviaria, the railway transportation subsidiary of Fiat SpA, by French company Alstom. Through the takeover Alstom will get in-house tilting technology and a foothold in the Italian railway market where so far it had been  rather unsuccessful in winning any  public procurement bids. </B></I>
<P>The takeover leads to competitive overlaps for mainline, regional and local trains as well as for certain components. The Commission did not have to decide on  whether  the market at stake has become European  as claimed by the merging parties  or national, since under both scenarios the acquisition did not raise competition concerns. 
<P>The only product market where Alstom's and Fiat Ferroviaria's interests  will theoretically  lead to high market shares is mainline trains, particularly in  Great Britain and Spain. However, on both markets the parties had won the relevant contracts jointly in a consortium. Therefore, there is no real addition of market shares.
<P>In the EU as a whole Alstom will become the clear market leader. However, Fiat Ferroviaria's market share has been in decline since 1995, as other competitors are able to offer tilting train technology, eroding its initial advantage of being the first on the market. As concerns the other four product markets with overlaps, the addition of market shares was either minimal (regional trains, propulsion), or several other strong competitors remained (local trains, converters ).
