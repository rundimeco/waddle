<P><B>Commission opens in-depth probe into the proposed acquisition of Mets</B><B>ä Tissue by SCA M</B><B>ölynlycke. </B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has decided to undertake a full, second phase investigation of the proposed purchase of Mets</B></I><I><B>ä Tissue by SCA M</B></I><I><B>ölnlycke (</B></I><I><B>"SCA</B></I><I><B>"). The Commission considers </B></I><I><B>that the proposed operation raises serious doubts about its compatibility with the common market  due to the strong positions that would arise on certain markets for hygienic tissue products. </B></I>
<P>SCA Mölnlycke ("SCA") is a wholly owned subsidiary of Swedish company Svenska Cellulosa AB, a forest industry  and paper company that specialises in the manufacture of absorbent hygiene products, corrugated packaging and graphic papers. SCA manufactures and distributes a variety of tissue-based hygiene products throughout the European Economic Area. SCA produces tissue-based products in most Member States of the European Union and in Poland and Russia.
<P>Metsä-Tissue is active in the production of tissue products and of baking and cooking papers. It is majority-owned (66%) by the Metsä-Serla Corp., a Finnish forest industry company. Metsä Tissue has production capacity in Germany, Finland, Sweden and Poland.
<P>The proposed acquisition would complete an extensive exchange of assets between Svenska Cellulosa and Metsä-Serla, involving three transactions. The Commission has authorised, under conditions, two of these transactions, i.e . the acquisition by Metsä-Serla of Modo and the purchase of Metsä Corrugated by SCA Packaging. The underlying business rationale is for each company to reinforce its market position in selected core areas, while withdrawing from other markets.
<P>Hygiene tissue products can be divided into different categories, toilet paper, kitchen towels, handkerchiefs napkins and so on. These products are either sold through retailers (consumer products) or to hotels, schools, hospitals etc (so-called 'Away from Home' products).  The parties and most other tissue manufacturers have developed their own branded products but also supply supermarkets and other large consumers with private label products.  
<P>The proposed acquisition will give rise to very high market shares for some consumer tissue products in Scandinavian countries. For AFH products, again  there would be very high market shares in the Nordic countries and high shares in other Member States. Although SCA has only small market shares in Finland it is the most credible competitive restraint to an existing duopoly between  Metsä Tissue and American company Fort James, each with about half of the tissue market there. The proposed operation by combining Metsä Tissue and SCA would remove SCA's constraining influence. 
<P>During the procedure the parties offered undertakings. These were considered to be unsatisfactory particularly because they did not address the problem outside Sweden Norway and Denmark. They also involved the splitting of brands on a geographical basis. Finally it was not clear that the remedies offered would resolve the competition problems within those countries. 
<P>The Commission has accordingly decided to undertake a full investigation of the case. It has a further four months from the date of that decision in which to make a final decision.
