<P>Today's meeting between Australian Minister for Justice and Customs Senator Amanda Vanstone and European Commissioner Viviane Reding, responsible for Sport policy, is a step further in the direction of close co-operation between the European Union and Australia in the fight against doping in sport. 
<P>While the initial set-up of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was developed by the European Union in conjunction with the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the Australian Government was instrumental in bringing non-European governments into WADA, through the International Drugs in Sport Summit in November 1999, making it a truly global body.
<P>Since then, both partners have been very active in the fight against doping. The European Union has adopted a support plan, which mobilises existing resources throughout its programmes in the fight against doping. Also, 2.5 million euro ($A3.88 million) are foreseen for information campaigns on doping in sport and conferences on ways to harmonise the fight against doping in sport at the European level. To this end, 16 pilot projects have been selected. Furthermore, three studies will be launched on anti-doping issues. Last but not least, 1.5 million euro ($A2.33 million) are foreseen for specific anti-doping information campaigns to be implemented by WADA.
<P>The Australian Government has continued its strong commitment to anti-doping by working with the IOC and WADA to strengthen the doping control program for the Sydney Games. The Australian Government contributed 200 tests to support the IOC's Pre-Games out-of-competition testing program and supported the appointment of WADA to independently monitor the Sydney Games doping control program.  The Australian Government also worked closely with the IOC to develop and validate a new test for EPO in time for the Sydney Olympic Games. Together, these initiatives have helped to ensure that the Sydney Games will have the toughest anti-doping program ever in place for an Olympic Games.
<P>Commissioner Reding and Minister Vanstone also discussed upcoming important decisions on the future of WADA, including the on-going implementation of WADA's world-wide testing program following the Sydney Games and WADA's future funding and operational priorities. They agreed to make sure that public authorities remained strongly committed to a fully functioning WADA with adequate geographical representation of governments from around the world.
