<a name="Heading4"></a><b>Competition: new rules for car distribution
bring dealers greater freedom to compete across the EU</b></h1>
<p><b><i>So-called ‘location clauses’ in contracts between carmakers
and dealers will, as of 1<sup>st</sup> October 2005, no longer benefit from
automatic (“block”) exemption from the EC Treaty’s prohibition
on restrictive business practices (Article 81) under the European
Commission’s car distribution Block Exemption Regulation 1400/2002. These
clauses have served to stop dealers from opening outlets outside geographical
territories defined by carmakers, including other EU Member States. However,
many carmakers and dealers have already removed these clauses from their
contracts. The change allows dealers to compete more widely, thereby
facilitating price competition and stimulating innovation in distribution. This
change concerning location clauses is the final part of the Commission’s
reform of competition rules for car distribution, the rest of which came into
force on 1 October 2002 (see <a
href="/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/02/1073&format=HTML&aged=1&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">IP/02/1073</a>).
The extra three years before the ‘location clauses’ lost the block
exemption was aimed at allowing carmakers and dealers time to adapt.</i></b></p>
<p>Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: “This measure stands to
further increase competition in the car distribution sector. I am pleased that
many carmakers have already eliminated location clauses from their distribution
agreements with dealers.”</p>
<p>The new rules concern passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. Once
location clauses are removed from contracts with carmakers, dealers can operate
outside their home territories, including across borders. This means that
dealers can set up outlets wherever they see a business opportunity, for example
in areas where their brand is under-represented or in countries where prices are
higher. This change also paves the way for innovative forms of distribution such
as multi-brand outlets. Consumers therefore stand to benefit from an improved
choice of dealers.</p>
<p>The Regulation allows carmakers to require dealers to meet defined quality
standards, ensuring a high quality dealership system for consumers. By requiring
that secondary sales outlets comply with all qualitative standards applicable to
dealerships in the area where the outlet is to be opened, and by checking
compliance in advance, carmakers can normally avoid the danger of unfair
free-riding on the investment and promotion efforts of existing dealers. The
Regulation expressly recognises the efficiencies of selective distribution
systems, which aim at stimulating investment by dealers to promote the brand in
their local area. </p>
<p>Secondary sales outlets are unlikely to increase carmakers’
transactional and logistical costs, as the contract in force with the dealer
will continue to determine where the carmaker must deliver the cars ordered by
the dealer. This means that where dealers open a secondary sales outlet in
another Member State, an additional contract with the local importer is not
needed, although the carmaker can of course delegate to the local importer
functions such as checking compliance with the qualitative criteria. The
purchasing conditions and sales targets will remain those applicable in respect
of the dealer’s primary location.</p>
<p>In order to benefit from the full legal certainty offered by the block
exemption Regulation, carmakers and dealers are obliged to remove location
clauses from their agreements no later than 30<sup>th</sup> September 2005. This
appears to be industry’s preferred option.</p>
<p>Carmakers and dealers that nevertheless maintain ‘location
clauses’ after 30<sup>th</sup> September 2005 may face investigation by
the Commission, national competition authorities or challenges before national
courts on the basis of the EC Treaty’s rules on restrictive business
practices (Article 81). The Regulation does not treat location clauses as clear
cut ‘hardcore restrictions’, but the onus would be on firms to
demonstrate, on a case by case basis, that a location clause met all conditions
required to justify an exception under Article 81(3) of the EC Treaty, and, in
particular, to show that there were significant benefits that outweighed the
restrictive effects of the location clause.</p>
