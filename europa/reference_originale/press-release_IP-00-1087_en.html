<P><B>Commission approves purchase of Unilever</B><B>'s European Bakery Supplies unit  by Dutch firm CSM nv</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has approved the acquisition of Unilever</B></I><I><B>'s European Bakery Supplies Business (</B></I><I><B>"EBSB</B></I><I><B>") by CSM nv of The Netherlands. The deal will have no significant impact on competition as CSM</B></I><I><B>'s share of the relevant markets will remain low.</B></I>
<P>Both CSM nv and EBSB produce and distribute convenience bakery supplies, including a wide range of bakery ingredients. EBSB also produces semi-finished bakery products. Which ever way the markets are defined, estimated market shares will be less than 15 per cent in every country except Germany, where the combined shares will be only marginally above 15 per cent.  
<P>Given the lack of any other competition concerns, the Commission has considered that the operation will not lead to the creation or strengthening of a dominant position within the Common Market or the European Economic Area.
