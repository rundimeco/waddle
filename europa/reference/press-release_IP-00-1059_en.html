<P><I><B>Chris Patten, EU Commissioner for External Relations, visiting Sweden today, issued the following statement on the FRY elections:</B></I>
<P>"It is clear that the people of Serbia have voted for spring after a very long political winter. They have demanded a new start for their country - the chance to consign to history the economic and political misery they have endured in recent years.
<P>They have bravely turned out in huge numbers to vote for change - peaceful change, delivered by the ballot box, in the face of a system rigged heavily against them.
<P>Their choice must be honoured. Any attempt by Milosevic to claim victory in these circumstances would be a fraud. 
<P>The people of Serbia have spoken loudly and clearly. Their voice has been heard in Europe and around the world; now the authorities in Serbia must ensure it is listened to at home."
