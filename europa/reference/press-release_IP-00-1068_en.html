<P><I><B>The EU and over twenty other WTO Members are tabling six papers in Geneva today aimed at bringing key public concerns including on the environment and rural development, into the heart of the ongoing agricultural negotiations.

Today's action in effect launches the 'non-trade concerns' debate in the Geneva talks.</B></I>
<P>Commenting on the papers, EU Commissioner for Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development Franz Fischler said: "An exclusive focus on trade liberalisation in the WTO talks would fail to take on board the legitimate demands of civil society. The EU is determined to see that public concerns on the quality of the environment and the viability of rural areas are brought to the fore in these talks. We have already tabled a proposal on animal welfare and today's joint initiative by over 20 Members of WTO will ensure that environmental and rural development concerns are properly addressed in the negotiations".
<P>Article 20 of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture - the basis for the current agricultural negotiations in Geneva - provides that the continuation of the reform process should take into account non-trade concerns, special and differential treatment to developing countries and the possible negative effects of the implementation of the reform programme on least-developed and net-food importing developing countries.

<P><B>Document tabled in WTO Special Session on Agriculture, 28.9.2000</B>
<P><B>NOTE ON NON-TRADE CONCERNS</B>
<P>Submission to the September Special Session of the WTO Committee on Agriculture by Barbados, Burundi, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, the European Communities, Fiji, Iceland, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Malta, Mauritius, Mongolia, Norway, Poland, Romania, Saint Lucia, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Switzerland and Trinidad and Tobago.
<UL><P>1. Article 20 of the Agreement on Agriculture provides that the continuation of the reform process should take into account non-trade concerns, special and differential treatment to developing countries and the possible negative effects of the implementation of the reform programme on least-developed and net-food importing developing countries. In this context, a Conference on Non-Trade Concerns in Agriculture attended by 40 countries and economies was held in Ullensvang, Norway, on 1-4 July 2000. The European Commission and the governments of Japan, Mauritius, Norway, the Republic of Korea and Switzerland organised the conference, which was attended by developing countries including least-developed countries and small island developing states, economies in transition, and developed countries.
<P>2. The broad objective of the conference was to provide a forum for discussion among developing and developed countries on non-trade concerns (NTCs). Subjects treated covered the specific and multifunctional characteristics of agriculture, agriculture's contribution to rural development, food security, environment and cultural diversity, and the need for flexibility in national policy design to address non-trade concerns, both from developed and developing country perspectives.  Each of the organisers contributed to the discussion with papers covering a vast array of issues and concerns common to developing and developed countries alike. The papers highlighted the wide diversity and specificity of agricultural systems worldwide. The six papers are attached.
<P>3. It was recognised that every country has the right, in accordance with mutually agreed rules, to address non-trade concerns, such as strengthening the socio-economic viability and development of rural areas, food security and environmental protection, and promoting the co-existence of various types of agriculture. In this context, special and differential treatment to developing and least-developed countries must also be ensured. It was also recognised that market forces alone could not address these non-trade concerns.
<P>4. We believe that this is a useful contribution to the work within the framework of paragraph (c) of Article 20 by the Special Session of the Committee of Agriculture, and we look forward to a fruitful discussion in this Committee.
