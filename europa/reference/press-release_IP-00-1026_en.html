<P><B>Commission takes decisions on three state aid cases in the motor vehicle sector in the United Kingdom</B></H3>

The case concerns a regional investment aid of </B></I><I><B>£ 40 million.

As regards the Rover Longbridge case, the Commission decided to close the investigation procedure, following the withdrawal by the UK authorities of their notification of State aid in July 2000.</B></I>
<P>The United Kingdom authorities notified on 25 July 2000 regional investment aid to Nissan Motor Manufacturing Ltd. (NMUK), leading to the transformation of the Nissan plant in Sunderland, in order to introduce the new Nissan "Micra" model. The total investment of the project amounts to £ 308.9 mn and the total proposed aid amounts to £ 40 mn. According to the UK authorities, the alternative location to Sunderland would be to carry out the investment in the Renault plant in Flins, France, and no decision as to the site of the production has yet been taken by Nissan. The project timing is from January 2001 until March 2005 and the start of production is planned for January 2003. Since the Commission at this stage has doubts on the necessity and proportionality of the aid, the eligibility of costs and the effects on theproduction capacity, it decided to open the investigation procedure in the case.
<P>At the same time, the Commission decided to raise no objections to the granting of £5 million of aid to Nissan for the Primera project, also at Sunderland. The purpose of the project , which was notified on 22 December 1999, is to transform part of the site, so as to enable the production of the new Nissan Primera. The investments will be carried out over approximately three years and will cost a total of £ 216 million. The Commission is satisfied that the aid is in conformity with the Community framework for state aid to the motor vehicle industry and is, therefore, compatible with the EC Treaty.
<P>In the Rover Longbridge case, the Commission initiated on 22 December 1999 a formal investigation procedure as regards £ 141 million of regional investment aid to be granted to the German carmaker BMW's envisaged investment in the Rover Longbridge plant. Since the UK Authorities withdrew their notification of state aid in July 2000, the Commission decided to close the investigation procedure noting the UK withdrawal. BMW had soldthe Rover cars production to the British Phoenix consortium on 9 May 2000.
