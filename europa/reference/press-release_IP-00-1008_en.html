<P><B>Protection of an important bird area: the Commission acts against Finland on mires of Kemihaara</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has decided to send a letter of formal notice (first warning letter) to Finland for failure to protect an important bird area called mires of Kemihaara in north-east Finland. The Finnish authorities recently granted a construction permit to the Vuotos power plant and artificial lake project which would drown approximately 250 square kilometres of mires and forests around the upper Kemijoki river, including the mires of Kemihaara where a great number of bird species listed in Annex I to the Wild Birds Directive are occurring. The Commission considers that there is evidence of non-application of the required nature conservation safeguards for projects or plans having negative impacts on important conservation sites. In another legal action pending in the European Court of Justice against Finland for non-designation of bird areas, the Commission argues that, in view of its ornitological importance, the mires of Kemihaara should have been designated as a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive.</B></I>
<P>Commenting on the decision, Margot Wallström, Environment Commissioner, said : « This decision stresses the importance of complying at the national level with the nature conservation procedures required by the Directives of the European Union. At the same time it is important to note that, by this decision, the Commission is not taking a position against or in favour of the building of the Vuotos power plant ».
<P>The Wild Birds Directive (Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds) is the Community's oldest piece of nature conservation legislation, and one of the most important.  It creates a comprehensive scheme of protection for the Community's wild bird species, covering the conservation of the most important bird habitats as well as controls on hunting and other forms of exploitation.  
<P>The Directive includes a requirement on Member States to designate a network of protected areas (known as special protection areas or SPAs) for the most threatened species and to send to the Commission all relevant information so that it can take all appropriate initiatives to ensure the coherence of the network. There are two categories of birds: vulnerable species listed in Annex I of the directive; and regularly occurring migratory species not listed in Annex I.  Within SPAs designated or to be designated, bird habitats must be protected from deterioration, and potentially damaging developments must be made subject to safeguards set out in Article 6 of the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild flora and fauna). 
<P>Article 6 of the Habitats Directive defines a step-wise procedure for considering plans and projects. According to Article 6(3), the competent authorities shall agree to a plan or project only after having ascertained that it will not adversely affect the integrity of the site concerned. 
<P>Article 6(4) sets out safeguards for a plan or a project which, in spite of the negative assessment of the implications for the site, must nevertheless be carried out. These safeguards include in particular: the absence of alternative solutions, the existence of imperative reasons of overriding public interest, including those of a social and economic nature and taking all compensatory measures to ensure that the overall coherence of Natura 2000 is protected.  On the information currently available to the Commission, it appears that the application of the safeguards of Article 6(4) have been implicitly avoided by wrongly deeming that the nature effects of the Vuotos power plant and artificial lake project are insignificant in relation to the mires of Kemihaara.
