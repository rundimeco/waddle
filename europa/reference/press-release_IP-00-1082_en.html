<P><B>Structural Funds: Commission approves Objective 3 training and employment package for Spain </B></H3>
<P><I><B>A 7-year education, training and employment programme for Spain, financed by the European Social Fund, was agreed by the Commission today. The 'Objective 3 Community Support Framework' (CSF) will support human resource initiatives in the seven Autonomous Communities of Aragon, the Balearic Islands, Catalonia, Madrid, Navarre, the Basque Country and La Rioja for the period 2000-2006. European Union funding for these seven years will total </B></I><I><B>€2 221 million. Today's decision is one of a series currently being adopted for all Member States to launch the new Structural Funds programming period.</B></I>
<P>Following today's decision, Anna Diamantopoulou, the European Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs said: "The regions eligible for support under this CSF, have experienced an upturn in economic growth and positive changes in the jobs market in recent years. Despite these improvements, considerable challenges remain, including higher unemployment rates among women and young people, high long-term unemployment rates among older workers and a growing need for workers and firms to be able to adapt to the demands of a changing economy. The CSF agreed today will respond to these challenges by supporting measures to boost job creation, to provide education and training opportunities, to reduce regional disparities and to fight all forms of discrimination in accessing the labour market". 
<P>The Spanish Objective 3 CSF has identified eight priority areas for European Social Fund support:
<UL><P><LI>Integrating the<B> unemployed</B> <B>into the labour market</B> by offering new opportunities to job seekers, including career guidance, training, information and assessment programmes. Greater focus will be given to early intervention and prevention of long term unemployment, before the six month of unemployment for young people and the twelve month of unemployment for adults. <B>€763 million</B> representing 34% of the budget. 
<P><LI>Strengthening of <B>entrepreneurial skills</B>, promotion of self-employment and the creation of small and medium sized enterprises, which harness the employment potential of the social economy, the environmental sector and new technologies. <B>€84 million</B> representing 4% of the budget. 
<P><LI>Fostering of <B>adaptability</B> for all workers and job <B>stability </B>for those most exposed to precarious employment.<B> </B>Measures<B> </B>will include training and retraining of workers, particularly in new technologies. This priority will focus in particular on SMEs and groups at greater risk of job loss. Support will also be given to improve co-ordination and co-operation between the regional and national employment services. <B>€593 million</B> representing 27% of the budget.
<P><LI>Improving <B>vocational training</B> by developing new curricula, boosting access to and knowledge of IT and encouraging closer links between schools and firms, notably to facilitate work experience schemes. Support will also be given to schemes aimed at preventing young people from leaving schools without any qualifications. <B>€184 million</B> representing 8% of the budget.
<P><LI>Developing the human potential in <B>research, science and technology</B> with a particular emphasis on fostering the transfer of results to industry. A particular effort will be made to allow smaller firms greater access to research and development. In this context, support will be given to activities promoting the exchange of experience or personnel between SMEs and research centres. <B>€86 million</B> representing 4% of the budget.
<P><LI>Boosting the <B>participation of women</B> in the labour market. Measures will include specific vocational training for women and support for entrepreneurial projects and initiatives which facilitate family and working life. The Social Fund will also finance measures to combat occupational segregation and wage discrimination. <B>€124 million </B>representing 6 % of the budget.  
<P><LI>Integrating <B>disadvantaged groups</B> into the jobs market. Men and women facing severe difficulties in accessing the labour market, including the disabled and immigrant workers and job seekers, will be offered a combination of measures, including training and counselling, to facilitate stable employment. <B>€230 million</B> representing 10% of the budget.
<P><LI>Promoting the <B>local economy </B>by providing support<B> </B>to initiatives, which develop new activities meeting local needs and creating employment. <B>€132 million </B>representing 6% of the budget.
</UL><P>Particular attention will be paid to promote both equal opportunities between men and women and the information society across all eight priority areas. 
<P>Finally, the European Social Fund will support technical assistance for the management of the programmes, in particular for evaluation.
<P>Total expenditure for the seven year period will amount to €5 117 million, of which €2 839 million will be contributed by the public sector, €56 million by the private sector and €2 221 million by the EU.
<P><B>Programme management </B>
<P>The CSF agreed today will be implemented through 11 'Operational Programmes' (OPs), which are set to be approved by the Commission shortly. Seven of these programmes are regional (one per autonomous community) and will be implemented on the ground by the relevant regional government. The remaining four are thematic, covering employment promotion, vocational training systems, entrepreneurship and life long learning, and social inclusion. The new CSF strengthens co-ordination between the OPs, as each must clearly show how it complements the others. Overall responsibility for the CSF lies with the national Ministry of Labour. 
<P>Once the Operational Programmes are approved by the Commission, the next procedural step will be the submission by the Spanish authorities to the Commission of a 'Programme Complement' per Operational Programme The Complement will set out in greater detail where and how the funds will be allocated, the various steps for project selection and the procedures to be followed to access the funds.
