<P>Commenting on the decisions, Environment Commissioner Margot Wallström said:  "Member States must make every effort to implement Community environmental directives such as these in full and on time".
<P>The Dangerous Substances Directive (Council Directive 67/548/EEC on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions in relation to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances) was adopted in 1967 and has since been amended a number of times. 
<P>Council Directive 97/69/EC adapts Directive 67/548/EEC to technical progress for the 23<SUP>rd</SUP> time. National transposing legislation was required to have been adopted and communicated to the Commission by the 16 December 1998 at the latest. The Netherlands adopted such legislation and communicated it to the Commission, but certain defects were identified. Whilst the Netherlands has now accepted to remedy these defects by passing new legislation, the currently adopted legislation remains defective. The Commission has therefore decided to refer the matter to the European Court of Justice. 
<P>Council Directive 98/73/EC adapts Directive 67/548/EEC to technical progress for the 24<SUP>th</SUP> time. National transposing legislation was required to have been adopted and communicated to the Commission by the 31 October 1999 at the latest. Finland has notified implementing legislation, but this fails to cover Åland. Portugal has not notified any implementing legislation to the Commission. The Commission therefore decided to issue reasoned opinions against both Member States.
