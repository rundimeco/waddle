<P><B>Commission opens an in-depth investigation into Metso</B><B>'s acquisition of Svedala</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has decided to open an in-depth investigation into the proposed acquisition by Metso Corporation of Svedala Industri AB. In view of both Metso</B></I><I><B>'s and Svedala</B></I><I><B>'s current market positions in the production of certain rock crushing equipment, the Commission has identified risks that the acquisition may lead to the creation of a dominant position on these markets. </B></I>
<P>Metso is a Finnish company, established in 1999 through the merger of Valmet Corporation and Rauma Corporation.  It is active in machinery, such as rock and mineral processing machinery, automation and control technology and fibre and paper technology. 
<P>Svedala is a Swedish construction and mineral processing company, which makes  equipment for mineral recovery, processing and drilling and rock crushing.
<P>The proposed transaction consists of the acquisition of sole control by Metso over Svedala through a public bid. The transaction would combine the parties' activities in the field of rock crushing equipment, which is currently sold by both Metso (under its Nordberg brand) and Svedala. 
<P>In general, rock crushing equipment is primarily used for the production of aggregates (for the construction industry) as well as cement, and for the mining industry. A typical rock crushing plant will usually involve several successive stages each of which involves a number of possible technologies. 
<P>The Commission investigation seems to support that rock crushing equipment could be segmented according to the technology used (for example jaw crushers and cone crushers), and also according to the type of application or the size of the equipment (namely, into smaller aggregate & construction applications and bigger mining applications). The markets for smaller crushers would appear to be national, whereas there are strong indications for the mining crusher market to be global.
<P>The operation will give rise to considerable competitive overlaps for smaller cone crushers and smaller jaw crushers in several EEA Member States. In view of the market positions of the parties and of the relative fragmentation of the rest of the industry, the Commission has therefore identified serious concerns that the operation could lead to the creation of a dominant position in smaller cone crushers and smaller jaw crushers in several Member States. 
<P>Finally, it cannot be excluded that the operation would give rise to competition concerns in certain mining markets, especially for the very large cone crushers. This will have to be investigated in more detail.
<P>European merger investigations are conducted under a legally binding timetable. From the date the Commission is fully informed of the details of the transaction (so-called notification), the Commission has a period of one month to make an initial assessment of the notified transaction. If the Commission comes to the conclusion that there are serious doubts whether an operation is compatible with the competition rules in the European single market, it initiates a full investigation. The Commission has a further four months to investigate the facts and to adopt the final decision whether or not to allow the proposed transaction to proceed. The opening of a full investigation is a procedural step without prejudice to the final outcome of the case.
<P>With the decision to open a full investigation in the case, the Commission will continue a detailed-fact finding exercise, using as a legal test the likelihood that the proposed acquisition might create or reinforce a dominant position. Pursuant to the bilateral agreement of 1991 on antitrust co-operation between the European Commission and the United States, the European Commission has co-operated with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the analysis of the transaction.  The Commission's decision to open an in-depth investigation in this case does not prejudice the outcome of the assessment in the United States. The investigation of the case in the United States has not yet terminated.
