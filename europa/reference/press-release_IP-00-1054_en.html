<P><B>Commission authorises acquisition by Schroder Ventures of Veba</B><B>'s Memec</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has cleared the acquisition of electronic components and systems distributor Memec by Schroder Ventures Ltd, through Cherrybright Ltd. The acquisition will not lead to the creation or strengthening of a dominant position and consequently does not raise any competition concerns.</B></I>
<P>Cherrybright Ltd is a special purpose vehicle controlled by funds advised by Schroder Venture European Fund Managers II LP (SVEF II). SVEF II is controlled by Schroder Ventures Limited which is part of Schroder Ventures. Schroder Ventures provides management, advisory and consultancy services to buy-outs and venture capital funds.
<P>The Memec Group is one of four operating divisions of VEBA Electronics, which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of E.ON AG. Memec is a wholesale distributor of electronic components and systems, in particular proprietary semiconductors. 
<P>No company within Schroder Ventures is active on the same markets as Memec. However, one of the companies controlled by Schroder, Austria Mikro Systems International AG (AMS), produces semiconductors, and in particular develops application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and application-specific standard products (ASSPs). 
<P>Even though AMS distributes its products directly to its customers and Memec currently does not distribute any of AMS's products, there is a potential vertical link between the two companies. However, given that neither Memec nor AMS have significant market shares (less than 25%) either separately or in combination irrespective of the market definition chosen, the transaction does not lead to any creation or strengthening of a dominant position.
