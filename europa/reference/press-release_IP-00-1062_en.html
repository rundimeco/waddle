<P><B>The Commission proposes the creation of a community aviation safety agency</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission today adopted a draft Regulation aimed at setting up a European Aviation Safety Agency. "The European Union will at last have the means to conduct a genuine aviation safety policy" said Loyola de Palacio, Vice-President in charge of transport and energy, adding that "the creation of an Aviation Safety Agency is a decisive step for Europe. It will enable us to continue to guarantee our citizens a level of safety that is among the highest in the world, while giving our industry the means to compete on an equal footing outside the EU."</B></I>
<P>The growth in air traffic is accelerating, and the public is rightly calling for a better quality of service with fewer delays and lower fares. However, they also want the highest possible level of safety and do not want the increase in air traffic to affect their environment. In response to these challenges, the European Commission today decided to propose the creation of a European Aviation Safety Agency responsible for the regulation of civil aviation's safety and its environmental compatibility.
<P><B>The Agency's role:</B>
<P>It will in particular:
<UL><P><LI>help the Community legislature draw up common standards to ensure the highest possible level of safety;
<P><LI>ensure that they are applied uniformly in Europe and that any necessary safeguard measures are taken; and
<P><LI>promote their worldwide adoption.
</UL><P>To ensure that the common standards are drawn up without any political interference, the Agency's decisions will be taken by its Executive Director, as is already the case in most industrialised countries, eg in the United States. It will itself carry out certain executive tasks where collective action is more effective than individual action by the Member States, as is the case with the issue of certificates for aeronautical products. It will also help the Commission monitor the correct application of the common rules.
<P>To ensure the environmental compatibility of aircraft, the Agency will encourage the harmonisation of technical rules and especially ensure their uniform application. While the Community has already set protection levels for noise and gaseous emissions, in the context of international standards, there are still many different interpretations of the common requirements, and this affects the free movement of aeronautical products.
<P>It will give the Commission technical assistance during negotiations with third countries' aeronautical authorities and the competent international organisations, and will also assist the Community and the Member States in development cooperation activities with third countries.
<P><B>Impact of harmonisation:</B>
<P>This common system will facilitate the activities of the aeronautical industry in Europe: a single certificate will be needed to place its products on the entire European market. Access to external markets will be simplified by the conclusion of agreements enabling the harmonisation and mutual recognition of certificates. All the European countries linked to the Community by agreements in which they undertake to apply the relevant Community legislation, i.e. at present Norway, Iceland and Switzerland and shortly all the accession candidate countries, will be associated with the work of the Agency.
<P>This strengthening of the free movement of individuals and services in the internal market and with third countries will also facilitate the development of cooperation and alliances between Europeans and their external partners.

<P><B>Why do we need a Community Aviation Safety Agency?</B>
<UL><P><B>To create a genuine internal market in aeronautical products while ensuring aviation safety</B>
</UL><P>Despite the harmonisation work carried out by the national authorities within the JAAs,<sup><a name="file.tmp_Ref_1"><a href="#file.tmp_Foot_1">(1)</a></a></sup> it is not unusual that a manufacturer still has to produce different versions of the same type of aircraft or equipment depending on the country where it is to be used. The requirements imposed on operators vary from one State to another and can at times create disparities between carriers competing on the same markets. That is why the Community and the various stakeholders in the sector have for years been striving to establish a genuine European Aviation Safety Authority able, like the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States, to draw up common standards designed to ensure the highest level of safety, ensure their uniform application in Europe, and promote their worldwide dissemination. 
<UL><P><B>To protect our environment from the effects of the growth in air traffic</B>
</UL><P>To protect our environment from the effects of aircraft, the Community also plans to set pollution protection levels, along the lines of what it has already done on noise. These requirements should be reflected in precise technical criteria to be complied with by aircraft before they are allowed to fly. Unfortunately, there are many differences in how these requirements are interpreted and this is likely to affect the free movement of aeronautical products. The existence of a single authority will make it possible to harmonise the technical rules and ensure their uniform application. 
<UL><P><B>To ensure the rapid deployment of the Community aviation safety system</B>
</UL><P>Back in 1996 the Commission proposed to transform the JAAs into a genuine international organisation with appropriate powers to play the role of a strong central authority acknowledged in Europe and the rest of the world as a centre of excellence for aviation safety and environmental protection. The Council agreed to this suggestion in July 1998, and in cooperation with interested parties the Commission departments started drawing up an International Convention which would have set up such an authority. It then became clear that the transfer of executive powers that would be needed in order to guarantee its strength and independence would raise awkward constitutional issues in certain European States and make it very uncertain whether the convention setting it up would be ratified. Accordingly, the Commission suggested to the Council that thought should be given to setting up this authority under the auspices of the Community, which can be delegated executive powers in the context of political and judicial scrutiny of the Treaty. On 26  June the Council gave the go-ahead for the creation of an authority under the auspices of the Commission, and the Commission today adopted a draft Regulation aimed at setting up a Community system to regulate the safety and environmental impact of civil aviation and creating a European Aviation Safety Agency. <p><sup><a name="file.tmp_Foot_1"><a href="#file.tmp_Ref_1">(1)</a></a></sup><SUP><B> </B></SUP><SUP><B>The Joint Aviation Authorities are an association of the national aviation authorities of 33 European States the aim of which is to harmonise rules and practice with regard to aviation safety and the environmental certification of aircraft. </B></SUP>
