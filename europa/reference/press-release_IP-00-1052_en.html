<P><B>Commission approves acquisition of Italdata's hardware business by Flextronics</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has approved the acquisition of the hardware manufacturing unit of Italian company Italdata by Flextronics International Ltd., a company registered in Singapore. Italdata is a joint venture between Siemens Nixdorf Informations Systeme AG, Telecom Italia S.p.A and Siemens Informatica S.p.A.</B></I>
<P>The acquisition will not result in any distortion of competition. The activities of Flextronics and Italdata's hardware business overlap only in the electronics manufacturing services, in particular the assembly of printed circuit boards, for the computer industry. Italdata's hardware business does not, however, add much to Flextronics' position and Flextronics will in any case have less than 25% of the computer industry segment of electronic manufacturing services in the European Economic Area. Furthermore, Flextronics is faced with several competitors in this segment, which is also characterized by strong, sophisticated buyers such as Nokia, Ericsson, Phillips, Cisco Systems and Hewlett Packard.
