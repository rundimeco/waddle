<P><B>The European Union leads on the eradication of anti-personnel landmines</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The EU is at the forefront of the fight against landmines, with more than 60 million mines lying hidden and a stockpile estimated at some 250 million. In 1999 the total EU contribution to external mine action amounted to </B></I><I><B>â‚¬103 million, making the Union the largest contributor world-wide. EU funding supported projects in almost every continent and covering a range of activities from mine surveying, detection and clearance, mine destruction and demining research to assistance to victims and mine awareness programmes.  In order to highlight and explain the Union</B></I><I><B>'s action in this area, External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten published a brochure, </B></I><I><B>"The Response of the European Union to the Anti-Personnel Landmines Challenge</B></I><I><B>", on the occasion of the Second Conference of the States participating into the Ottawa Convention which took place in Geneva from 11-15 September 2000. </B></I>
<P>This is an initial step to improve public awareness of the EU's engagement in the fight against landmines. The Commission has also submitted a proposal for a framework regulation on mine action in order to enhance coherence and effectiveness of the Union's mine projects. The proposal, which is currently under discussion in the Council of Ministers and European Parliament, will also facilitate co-operation with the many NGOs which do valuable work in the battle against landmines.
<P>The Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction (Ottawa Convention) which entered into force on 1 May 1999 was a turning point for the international community.
<P>For the European Commission the Convention has been an opportunity to reflect on lessons learned in the past. With the Presidency of the European Union and under the lead role played by the European Parliament, we are returning to the battle against landmines with fresh vigour and  focus. In the process, on 14 March 2000 the European Commission approved a Communication to the European Parliament and the Council, as well as a draft regulation on action against anti-personnel landmines, thus reinforcing the contribution even further of the European Union.
