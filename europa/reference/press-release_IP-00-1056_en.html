<P><B>Commission approves acquisition of joint control of Czech publisher Stratosfera by VNU and Hearst </B></H3>
<P><I><B>The European Commission has approved the acquisition of joint control of Stratosfera,, by  Dutch publisher VNU and Hearst of the United States. The operation raises no competition concerns because Stratosfera is not present on the European Economic Area (EEA)  market.  </B></I>
<P>Stratosfera sr.o. is a publishing company incorporated under the laws of the Czech Republic and is jointly controlled by VNU, Hearst and a Czech national. Stratosfera publishes several Czech language consumer magazines in the Czech Republic, including magazines under licenses of The Hearst Corporation
<P>VNU Stratosfera B.V. is a subsidiary of Dutch based VNU N.V., an international publishing and information company that provides consumer and professional information, based in the Netherlands. The primary publishing business areas of VNU N.V. are consumer magazines and educational publishing. 
<P>Hearst Enterprises B.V. is part of The Hearst Corporation, a large diversified US-based communications company, whose major interests include newspaper, magazine and business publishing.
<P>The market for these magazines is considered to be of national scope; therefore Stratosfera is not present on the EEA market.
<P>As a result, the concentration will not lead to the creation of a dominant position on any market within the Common Market or the EEA and the Commission has therefore decided not to oppose the operation.
