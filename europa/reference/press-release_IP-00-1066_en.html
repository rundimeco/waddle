<P><B>The Commission adopts its Communication on Structural Indicators</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The Communication proposes the set of indicators to be used in the Synthesis Report for the spring 2001 European Council in Stockholm. The 27 indicators proposed provide a good balance across the four policy domains agreed in Lisbon: employment, innovation, economic reform and social cohesion.

According to Pedro Solbes, EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, </B></I><I><B>"the indicators provide an instrument for monitoring, benchmarking and peer pressure which are vital elements of the Lisbon follow-up strategy</B></I><I><B>".</B></I>
<P><B>I</B><B> </B><B> Objective of the Communication</B>
<P>The objective of the Communication is to propose a set of  indicators to be used in the Commission's synthesis report for the Spring 2001 European Council in Stockholm. The Communication answers the requests from the Lisbon and Feira Councils. In particular, the Feira European Council asked the Commission to present a report on indicators to be used in the synthesis report by the end of September.
<P>The use of indicators and benchmarks allows for an open assessment and comparison between Member States and other developed economies. This helps to show where there is scope for improvement in the Union and also encourages Member States' governments to pursue reforms in these areas more vigorously. In this respect these indicators will provide a vital instrument for monitoring and comparing progress in the follow-up to the Lisbon strategy
<P><B>II</B><B> </B><B> Criteria for the choice of indicators</B>
<P>The choice of indicators is guided by the purpose of the synthesis report, which is to assess the degree of progress made towards Lisbon's strategic goal of transforming the European Union into "the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion."  To assess progress towards the strategic goal the indicators cover the four policy domains mentioned in the Lisbon conclusions: employment, innovation, economic reform and social cohesion.
<P>The Communication therefore proposes a list of 27 indicators in these four policy domains and includes some economic background indicators to present the economic context in which structural reforms take place
