<P>Recent surveys indicate European citizens are becoming increasingly concerned about air pollution, noise, danger and stress caused by traffic. At the same time, the number of cars on the road continues to grow in European cities, while a significant majority of all car trips made in Europe cover a distance of less than 5 km. 
<P>The European Car Free Day initiative aims to raise awareness of the need to change mobility patterns. It enables citizens to see the benefits of a 'car free' environment whilst representing a platform for dialogue on the development of transport and urban planning. It also allows city councils to test new transport concepts in situ (gas buses, pedestrian areas, electric vehicles for goods delivery, cycle network etc.). 
<P>This year's Car Free Day initiative follows the success of the "In town without my car" days held in 1998 in 35 French cities and in 1999, when, with the support of the LIFE programme, 66 French cities were joined by 92 Italian cities. On 22 September, car-free areas were established in large parts of city centres, enabling citizens to discover their hometown on foot, by bicycle or public transport, and to test new low emission vehicles. Conventional goods vehicles were replaced by electric or zero emission alternatives and public transport fares were discounted for the day. In 1999 22 million people participated in the campaign, with more than 80 % wishing to see the operation repeated regularly in the future.  Also at the 1999 event, Commission President Romano Prodi and Commissioner Margot Wallström took a cycle ride with members of their staff through the streets of Brussels, accompanied by Mrs Isabelle Durant, Belgian Transport Minister.
<P>The conference venue is the Palais des Congrès, Coudenberg 3, 1000 Brussels. There will be a press conference by Commissioner Wallström and Ministers at 11h15 in the salle Mercator.<p><sup><a name="file.tmp_Foot_1"><a href="#file.tmp_Ref_1">(1)</a></a></sup><SUP><I> </I></SUP><SUP><I>The Car Free Cities is a network  of some 70 European cities which was created in 1994 by Eurocities and the Directorate General for Environment to study, to develop and to exchange good practices in the field of sustainable mobility by local authorities</I></SUP>
