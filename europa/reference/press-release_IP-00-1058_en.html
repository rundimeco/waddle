<P><B>Commission authorises joint venture between PSA and Vivendi</B></H3>
<P><I><B>The Commission has given the go-ahead to a plan by the French vehicle manufacturer Peugeot and Vivendi, the holding company of the French services and communications group, to set up a 50/50 joint venture, Wappi!, which will essentially bring together activities to develop, provide and integrate Internet-based services for cars, including mobile Internet.</B></I>
<P>The operation will involve the creation of a 50/50 joint venture, Wappi !, by the French manufacturer of Peugeot and Citroën cars and by Vivendi, which is active on the fixed telephony market through Cégétel and on the mobile telephony market through SFR. 
<P>Wappi! will be responsible for developing, providing and integrating Internet-based services for cars, including mobile Internet. The services will relate in particular to safety, maintenance, mobility and navigational aids, leisure and comfort.
<P>The Commission's analysis showed that the new entity will have to compete with a number of large operators offering identical services such as Odysline (Renault), Viasat (subsidiary of Magnetti Marelli and Telecom Italia) and On Star (General Motors). The Commission thus concluded that the operation would neither create nor strengthen a dominant position.
