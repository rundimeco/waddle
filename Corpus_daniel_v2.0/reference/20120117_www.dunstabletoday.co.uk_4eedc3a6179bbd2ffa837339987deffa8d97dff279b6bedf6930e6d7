<p>Norovirus closes five wards at L&D;</p>
<p>PATIENTS at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital have been struck with the winter vomiting disease, Norovirus.</p>
<p>Five wards at the hospital are closed so far, and they are all elderly medical wards.</p>
<p>Visitors are banned from wards except for where the patient is critically ill, for example in the Intensive Care Unit.</p>
<p>An L&D; spokesperson said: “The L&D; has several cases of winter vomiting disease (norovirus). In order to protect our patients, and members of the public, we are closing hospital wards to all visitors (with some exceptions).</p>
<p>“Additionally we are asking the public only to come to A&E; if it is a real emergency, and if people do need to come to A&E; please don’t bring the whole family - just one person to accompany the patient.</p>
<p>“These measures are necessary to protect our patients and public from the highly contagious norovirus which causes projectile vomiting and uncontrollable diarrhoea.”</p>
<p>The ban on visitors is expected to last for 24-48 hours.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said if members of the public think they may have winter vomiting disease, they should not go to A&E; as there is no treatment for this virus, it needs to run its course over two or three days.</p>
<p>The best advice is stay indoors, isolate yourself from other people and drink lots of water to keep rehydrated.</p>
