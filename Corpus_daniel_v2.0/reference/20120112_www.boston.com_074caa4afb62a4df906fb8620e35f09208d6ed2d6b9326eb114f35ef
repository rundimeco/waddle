<p>After cancer hit, women lobbied for a bald Barbie</p>
<p>NEW YORKâ€”Barbie has been an astronaut, an architect, a NASCAR driver, and a news anchor.</p>
<p>Now, there's an online movement to get her to attempt what could be her biggest feat yet: going bald to fight cancer.</p>
<p>A Facebook page titled "Beautiful and Bald Barbie! Let's see if we can get it made" was started a few days before Christmas. By Wednesday afternoon, the page had more than 16,000 fans. The goal is to get toy maker Mattel Inc. to create a bald Barbie in support of children with cancer.</p>
<p>Friends Rebecca Sypin and Jane Bingham, who live on opposite coasts but have both been affected by the disease, hatched the idea to use Barbie for the movement because she's such a popular children's toy.</p>
<p>Bingham has lost her hair due to chemotherapy treatments to treat lymphoma. Sypin's 12-year-old daughter, Kin Inich, also lost her hair this year in her own battle with leukemia.</p>
<p>Mattel didn't return calls on Wednesday seeking comment, but the women said they have contacted the company through some general form letters. In return, they said, they've received form letters that say Mattel doesn't accept ideas from outside sources.</p>
<p>The women say a bald Barbie would provide a huge platform to raise awareness for children with cancer.</p>
<p>Barbie, all 11.5 inches of her, is one of the best-known toys of all time. She can sell for $10 at Wal-Mart or $7,000 on eBay.</p>
<p>Barbie also has taken on all sorts of incarnations throughout her nearly 53 years of existence, crushing stereotypes and showing little girls that they can be whatever they want to be. There's been an elegant Grace Kelly Barbie; a Barbie in thigh-high pink boots; a tattooed Barbie; a pregnant Barbie friend, and another Barbie friend in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>But Barbie has also been dissed for not being as socially responsible as she could be. She's best known for her curves, which long have sparked complaints by women's groups that say she imposes an unachievable physical standard on young girls. She also was lambasted when a talking version uttered an exclamation about math class being hard.</p>
<p>The friends who started the "Beautiful and Bald Barbie" movement aren't natural activists. Sypin, 32, is a special-education teacher's aide in Lancaster, Calif. Bingham, 41, is a photographer in Sewell, N.J.</p>
<p>"We're not demanding that the company do anything," Sypin said Wednesday. "We're just hoping somebody sees this and can help us make it happen."</p>
<p>Overall, Sypin said she's been pleased with the response to the Facebook page. For instance, one fan of the page wrote of Mattel: "If they are making dolls that are inspiring young girls with careers then why not make a doll that would inspire young girls who are dealing with Cancer."</p>
<p>Some commenters even suggested the friends extend the movement to include a boys' toy. So, over the weekend, the women started an accompanying Facebook page, "Bald G.I. Joe Movement."</p>
<p>Hasbro Inc., the maker of G.I. Joe, didn't immediately return a call for comment.</p>
<p>The movement has its critics, too.</p>
<p>Some people have told the women to just take a normal Barbie and shave her hair off to make the same point. Bingham posted photos where she did just that -- resulting in patchy, unattractive clumps on Barbie's head. She also posted digitally doctored pictures of a bald Barbie to show how beautiful the doll could be.</p>
<p>And to people who say that it makes more sense to just donate to cancer research rather than to buy a bald Barbie?</p>
<p>"A lot of these people wouldn't have even thought about doing that without this movement," Bingham said.</p>
