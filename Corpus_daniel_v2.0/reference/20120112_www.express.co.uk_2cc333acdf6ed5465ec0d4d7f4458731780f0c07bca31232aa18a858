<p>SIMPLE JAB THAT COULD CURE BRITAIN'S OBESITY CRISIS</p>
<p>A simple once-a-day fat-busting jab could be the key to battling ­Britain's obesity crisis</p>

<p>In trials of the drug, patients have lost at least half a stone (7lb). One apparently shed up to four stone after taking the treatment.</p>
<p>Injections of the hormone can also cut blood pressure and cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>One obesity expert hailed the ground-breaking findings as ­"potentially revolutionary".</p>
<p>Doctors already use it to treat diabetics. The hormone, called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), is secreted from the intestine when we eat and is the body's natural way of ­suppressing appetite.</p>
<p>People taking it feel less hungry and it is already used in Britain to treat type 2 diabetes because of its ability to regulate blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>Dr David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said: "These new injections really have the potential for revolutionising treatment. Safety-wise they are pretty good. I am using them on my patients and have had a lot of ­success. For some they have been dramatically successful, with one losing about four stone and having blood sugar under control for the first time ever."</p>
<p>Modification of diet and lifestyle remains the cornerstone of the treatment of type 2 diabetes</p>

<p>Researchers at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark analysed the results of 25 trials involving more than 6,000 patients to assess the effect of GLP-1 on weight loss, blood pressure, cholesterol and liver enzyme levels, as well as blood sugar control.</p>
<p>They found that patients given a daily dose for at least 20 weeks achieved weight loss of half a stone.</p>
<p>However, common side-effects included nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. But researchers say it did not appear to affect the numbers dropping out of the trials, suggesting that overall patient ­satisfaction with the treatment is relatively high.</p>
<p>Professor Tina Vilsboll, who led the research published in the ­British Medical Journal, said: "Our analysis provides convincing ­evidence that GLP-1 chemicals, when given to obese patients with or without diabetes, result in ­clinically relevant beneficial effects on body weight.</p>
<p>"Additional beneficial effects on blood pressure and total cholesterol might also be achieved."</p>
<p>The researchers believe that the treatment "should be considered in patients with diabetes who are obese or overweight".</p>
