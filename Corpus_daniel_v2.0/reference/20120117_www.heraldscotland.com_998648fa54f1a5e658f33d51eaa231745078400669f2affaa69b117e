<p>Study reveals health potential of chocolate</p>
<p>IT'S what chocoholics have claimed all along.</p>
<p>Chocolate, according to new research published today, can be good for you.</p>
<p>Chocolate and cocoa have been found to reduce the risk of heart disease in women with type 2 diabetes, claims a study by the University of East Anglia (UEA).</p>
<p>The 12-month trial, published in the journal Diabetes Care, found that regular consumption of flavonoid-rich foods such as chocolate, berries, tea and red wine, can help in the management of diabetes, which affects almost 200,000 people in Scotland.</p>
<p>Half of the women in the study were given two small bars of flavonoid-enriched chocolate, formulated with the help of a Belgian chocolatier, each day. The other half received placebo chocolate bars.</p>
<p>Women receiving the extra flavonoids reduced their risk of suffering a heart attack in the next decade by 3.4%. Their insulin resistance and cholesterol levels were also significantly reduced by the flavonoids.</p>
<p>Professor Aedin Cassidy of Norwich Medical School at UEA said: "These results are significant from a public health perspective because they provide further concrete evidence that diet has a beneficial clinical effect over and above conventional drug treatment."</p>
<p>However, Dr Iain Frame, director of research at Diabetes UK, which funded the study, emphasised the results do not mean women with type 2 diabetes should eat more chocolate.</p>
<p>He stressed that commercially available chocolate does not contain nearly as much flavonoid as the women in this trial consumed, and eating too much can lead to weigh gain.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown dietary flavonoids reduce the risk factors for heart disease in healthy people. However, this is the first long-term study to examine their effect on a medicated, high-risk group.</p>
<p>Dr Frame said: "It will be interesting to see whether larger studies of different flavonoids in more diverse populations over longer periods demonstrate similar effects."</p>
