<p>Anti-ageing hope for Vitamin D</p>
<p>Vitamin D supplements may have wide-ranging anti-ageing properties including the preservation of eyesight, research suggests.</p>
<p>Middle-aged mice treated with the vitamin for six weeks underwent changes in their eyes that led to improved vision.</p>
<p>Levels of amyloid beta, a toxic protein linked to Alzheimer's disease and known to be a hallmark of ageing, were also reduced in the animals' eyes and blood vessels.</p>
<p>Although the research is still at an early stage, scientists believe it could have important implications for human health.</p>
<p>Boosting vitamin D intake may have broad anti-ageing effects and in particular help prevent loss of vision and blindness in older people, it is claimed.</p>
<p>Lead scientist Professor Glen Jeffery, from the Institute of Ophthalmology at University College London, said: "Finding that amyloid deposits were reduced in the blood vessels of mice that had been given vitamin D supplements suggests that vitamin D could be useful in helping to prevent a range of age-related health problems, from deteriorating vision to heart disease."</p>
<p>Age-related inflammation and damage to the eye's retina can lead to macular degeneration, the biggest cause of blindness in people over the age of 50 in the developed world.</p>
<p>By the time a person is 70, the effects of normal ageing can lead to a 30% reduction in the number of light receptive cells in the retina.</p>
<p>The research findings are published in the journal Neurobiology of Aging.</p>
