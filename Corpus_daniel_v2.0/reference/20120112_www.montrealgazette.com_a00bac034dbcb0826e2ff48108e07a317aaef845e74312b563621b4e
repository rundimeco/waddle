<p>Police seek more sexual victims of HIV-infected man</p>
<p>Police are seeking more victims of a Toronto-area man who they say had sexual relations with women without disclosing he was HIV-positive.</p>
<p>York Regional Police on Wednesday issued a picture of Sarbjit Singh Mann, 39, of Stouffville, Ont., who was charged this week with aggravated sexual assault and criminal negligence.</p>
<p>Authorities have identified one person they say is one of the accused's victims and are hoping the photo will prompt more to come forward.</p>
<p>"We don't know how many victims there are" said Sgt. Gary Phillips of the York police. "That's the purpose of putting (the photo) out."</p>
<p>HIV is a virus that often progresses to give people the deadly AIDS disease.</p>
<p>Dr. Julio Montaner, director of the B.C. Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, recently wrote in the Canadian Medical Association Journal that it should not be a crime for HIV-infected people to withhold their condition to sexual partners.</p>
<p>He argued that advances in medicine have made it possible to "virtually eliminate" the risk of transmitting HIV to another person through sex.</p>
