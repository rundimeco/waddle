<p>15 Wing Moose Jaw plane crash report released</p>
<p>A report released this week by the Directorate of Flight Safety says a 15 Wing Moose Jaw plane engine seized before it crashed nearly four years ago.</p>
<p>The report says a stress crack caused an engine blade to fail, creating an imbalance and resulting in the engine seizing up.</p>
<p>The crash sent a student and his instructor to hospital during a training flight.</p>
<p>The instructor took over the plane but wasnâ€™t able to make it back on the runway. The pilots ejected from the plane. They were seriously injured upon landing.</p>
<p>One pilot was in hospital for most the week.</p>
<p>The report links this crash to another crash in Cold Lake this past summer, saying a stress crack could also be responsible for the most recent incident that forced an operational pause in training.</p>
<p>Maintenance procedures have changed for the Hawk since the link was made.</p>
<p>Before the crash in 2008, engine blades were replaced every 2,000 hours of operation.</p>
<p>In the months that followed, it was decided that the blades should be changed every 1,000 hours. Following the crash in Cold Lake in June of 2011, further changes were made and now the blade life has been further reduced to 400 hours.</p>
<p>While the report has now been released, the Directorate of Flight Safety says they are continuing to investigate the root cause of the blade fatigue.</p>
