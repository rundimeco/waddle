<p>GMC plans assisted suicide guidance</p>
<p>The General Medical Council (GMC) is to issue guidance on how to deal with complaints against doctors who may have assisted in suicides.</p>
<p>Case examiners and the regulator's investigation committee will be advised about what action to take over allegations that doctors have helped people to die. There will be a public consultation on the draft guidance once it is published in January.</p>
<p>It follows a patient asking the GMC what advice or support, if any, doctors could give to patients who were considering ending their lives.</p>
<p>Niall Dickson, chief executive of the GMC, said: "The issue of assisted suicide is complex and sensitive. We already have clear guidance for doctors that they must always act within the law and assisting or encouraging suicide remains a criminal offence. This guidance will not in any way change the legal position for doctors.</p>
<p>"We recognise, however, that there are a range of actions which could be considered as assisting in a suicide, such as providing information to a patient about suicide or providing practical assistance for someone to travel to a clinic such as Dignitas.</p>
<p>"Some of these actions may not lead to criminal charges but may still lead to complaints to us about a doctor's fitness to practise."</p>
<p>The guidance will include factors that might be relevant in determining the seriousness of each case. It will not cover euthanasia -in which a doctor's actions lead to a patient's death - as this is already covered by existing guidance.</p>
<p>In the last decade, the GMC has examined three cases where a doctor was said to have helped somebody to die.</p>
<p>One resulted from a conviction for assisting suicide in Canada and none from any conviction in the UK.</p>
