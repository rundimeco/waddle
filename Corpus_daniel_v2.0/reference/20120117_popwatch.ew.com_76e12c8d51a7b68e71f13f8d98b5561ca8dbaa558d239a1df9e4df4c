<p>Paula Deen has diabetes, tells 'Today' it is 'not a death sentence'</p>
<p>Paula Deen, the Southern-style cook whose drawl is as rich as some of her dishes, has Type 2 diabetes. She made the announcement yesterday in a release for her new Diabetes in a New Light website and products.</p>
<p>This morning on Today, the Food Network star admitted to Al Roker she learned of her diagnosis during a routine check-up three years ago but decided not to take that news public until she could “bring something to the table when I came forward.”</p>
<p>Deen, whose menu has been criticized by other celebrity chefs for being unhealthy, insisted to Roker that she always encouraged moderation when it comes to diet, including her own.</p>
<p>Watch the clip below:</p>
<p>Is the sad news that Deen has diabetes complicated in your mind by the fact that she’s now a paid spokesperson for a pharmaceutical company? Did she have any responsibility to share the news of her illness with her loyal foodies sooner?</p>
