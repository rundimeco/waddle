<p>Pay attention! Serious accidents triple for pedestrians wearing headphones</p>
<p>Serious accidents involving pedestrians wearing headphones while using electronic devices such as iPods have tripled, warn researchers.</p>
<p>They found a dramatic rise in injuries to people using headphones while walking in the street, particularly among young men.</p>
<p>There is increasing concern about the near trance-like state people can apparently enter while using mobile phones, MP3 players or electronic personal organisers.</p>
<p>Psychologists call this ‘divided attention’ or ‘inattentional blindness’ and it has become a focus for road safety campaigners.</p>
<p>A U.S. study shows the number of people suffering serious injury while using headphones tripled in six years.</p>
<p>The research, published in the Injury Prevention journal, analysed U.S. data from 2004 to last year on injuries to pedestrians using headphones.</p>
<p>Cases involving mobile phones, including hands-free, or cyclists were excluded.</p>
<p>During the study period, there were a total of 116 reports of death or injury, jumping from 16 in 2004/5 to 47 in 2010/11.</p>
<p>Eighty-one of the 116 collisions – 70 per cent – resulted in the person dying. In a quarter of cases a warning – such as a horn or siren – was sounded before the crash.</p>
<p>Two out of three victims were men and under the age of 30, with around one in ten of all cases under the age of 18.</p>

<p>Nine out of ten cases occurred in urban areas and more than half of the victims were struck by trains.</p>
<p>The data used in the analysis was from the U.S. National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Google news archives and a university research database.</p>
<p>Private world: Previous studies have shown people wearing headphones or talking on a mobile phone respond less to external stimuli such as sounds and traffic when crossing the street</p>
<p>Study leader Dr Richard Lichenstein, of the University of Maryland Hospital for Children in Baltimore, said: ‘The use of headphones may pose a safety risk to pedestrians, especially in environments with moving vehicles.’</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown people wearing headphones or talking on a mobile phone respond less to external stimuli, such as sounds and traffic when crossing the street.</p>
<p>Andrew Howard, head of road safety at the AA, said: ‘Pedestrians and cyclists seem to get lost in a private cocoon when they’re on a mobile in the street, or wearing headphones.</p>
<p>‘Precise figures don’t appear to be available here. There are many close calls. You’ve only got to look around to see it’s on the rise.’</p>
