<p>TALLAHASSEE January 11, 2012 – The Department of Children and Families and the Florida Coalition for Children (FCC) today unveiled a "Scorecard" targeted at measuring success as the nation’s preeminent social service network continues to evolve and protect Florida's families every day.</p>
<p>The Scorecard was developed in conjunction with the 20 community-based care lead agencies across the state. These nonprofit organizations contract with the state to handle all prevention, foster care, adoption and Independent Living services to children and families in the child welfare system. The Scorecard will be updated monthly and evaluate the lead agencies on 12 key measures to determine how well they are meeting the most critical needs of these at-risk children.</p>
<p>“Florida’s system of community-based care has become a national model over the past decade,” said Department Secretary David Wilkins. “This tool will allow the sharing of best practices and ensure proven successful methods are being used statewide to further improve child safety and well-being.”</p>
<p>The scorecard will measure the lead agencies across each indicator, including child safety, family preservation, adoptions, and well-being of children in foster care such as medical and dental services and educational goals.</p>
<p>“As providers, the community-based care system is one of the most closely monitored and evaluated systems in the state, perhaps in the country even,"</p>
<p>said Mike Cusick, FCC president and CEO. "Our goal in working to develop this scorecard with DCF is to ensure that the measures highlight areas where we are succeeding, while identifying areas of improvement to ensure the system achieves its ultimate goal of keeping kids safe and building strong families."</p>
