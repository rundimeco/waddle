<p>Elton John to pen personal story about AIDS</p>
<p>LONDON (Reuters) - Elton John will write a personal account of his life during the AIDS epidemic, including his friendship with Queen frontman Freddie Mercury who died of an AIDS-related illness in 1991 aged 45.</p>
<p>The "Rocket Man" musician founded the Elton John AIDS Foundation around 20 years ago to raise funds to help fight the disease, and proceeds from "LOVE IS THE CURE: Ending the Global AIDS Epidemic" will go to the charity.</p>
<p>In a statement released on Monday, publishers Hodder & Stoughton promised a "very personal story of ... Elton's life during the AIDS epidemic, including his agony at seeing friend after friend perish needlessly."</p>
<p>Among the individuals it describes are Mercury and Ryan White, an American boy who became a "poster child" for HIV/AIDS after he was banned by a school because of his condition.</p>
<p>According to reports at the time, John was with White when he died in a U.S. hospital in 1990 aged 18.</p>
<p>"This is a disease that must be cured not by a miraculous vaccine, but by changing hearts and minds, and through a collective effort to break down social barriers and to build bridges of compassion," John said.</p>
<p>"Why are we not doing more? This is a question I have thought deeply about, and wish to answer -- and to help change -- by writing this book."</p>
<p>An estimated 34 million people worldwide had the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS in 2010, up 17 percent on 2001 when 28.6 million were living with HIV.</p>
<p>According to the Hodder statement, HIV/AIDS has claimed 60 million lives.</p>
<p>Hodder & Stoughton acquired LOVE IS THE CURE with U.S. sister company Little, Brown and Company.</p>
<p>It is due to be published in July 2012 to coincide with the 2012 XIX International AIDS Conference to be held in Washington DC.</p>
