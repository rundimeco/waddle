<p>Boy swallows coin on way to get ice cream</p>
<p>A young New Zealand boy became seriously ill after swallowing a $NZ2 coin while on his way to spend it on an ice cream.</p>
<p>And with the coin now safely removed from his throat the "chirpy" 10-year-old still wants to invest it in a cold treat.</p>
<p>His parents, however, plan to save the coin for his 21st birthday as a reminder of his, in hindsight, "quite funny" ordeal.</p>
<p>The boy was walking to a dairy in Tauranga with his two siblings to buy an ice cream about 4pm on Sunday.</p>
<p>He can't remember why, but he put the dirty $NZ2 coin his parents had given him into his mouth.</p>
<p>It then became lodged in his throat, causing him to gag and throw up for close to eight hours.</p>
<p>He was initially taken to Tauranga Hospital, but because of concerns about the coin moving around, he was transferred to Waikato Hospital in the Westpac Rescue Helicopter.</p>
<p>The boy's father said his son – who he did not want named – had an uncomfortable night in hospital.</p>
<p>"He unfortunately was rather unwell right the way through till midnight because, of course, the coin kept moving.</p>
<p>"He could breathe okay, there were times when he couldn't, but he couldn't swallow and he kept, of course, gagging."</p>
<p>Hospital staff were able to remove the coin from the boy's oesophagus, and yesterday, apart from having "a little bit of a sore throat", he was back to his normal self.</p>
<p>Mr Ottaway said his son couldn't remember the ordeal as he had been in shock, and it remained a mystery as to how the coin became stuck.</p>
<p>"It's quite funny in some respects because it's just one of those unexpected things," he said.</p>
<p>"You just don't expect your kid's going to end up swallowing something that causes so many dramas."</p>
<p>Hospital staff told Mr Ottaway that Sundays were commonly "a busy day for swallowings".</p>
<p>"They have actually had quite a number of batteries, marbles up noses, little tiny army men and all sorts.</p>
<p>"Kids get bored and go, 'I wonder if this will go up."'</p>
<p>Clinical nurse manager Diana Knight said if a child swallows something that becomes lodged in the throat, it was important for parents or caregivers to take them to a doctor to dislodge it.</p>
