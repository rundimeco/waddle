<p>FDA fines Red Cross nearly $9.6 million for blood safety lapses</p>
<p>Who's going to pocket all this cash? That's the question that needs an answer, and I bet it's the FDA people getting rich by fining places like the Red cross and others.</p>
<p>I suppose this is the bonus money for the FDA.</p>
<p>What's more amusing is .01 is 1% and I was multiplying by 1% and not 1/10 of 1%</p>
<p>My wife died as a result of contaminated blood she received from a blood transfusion after 22 years of suffering. I didn't even recieve an appology from the Red Cross or the hospital that administered the infected blood, and we recieved nothing from them other than the hundres of thousands of dollars in medical expenses that my insurance didn't cover. No information on the source of the contaminated blood, no confirmation that the contaminated blood was purged from the blood supply. Nothing. 9.6 mil is a pittance when you look at the pain and suffering their mismanagement has caused.</p>
<p>This is why we have oversight. If the Federal government doesn't step in and take charge of the situation, we will continue to lose our loved ones to their lack of adequate management of the blood supply.</p>
