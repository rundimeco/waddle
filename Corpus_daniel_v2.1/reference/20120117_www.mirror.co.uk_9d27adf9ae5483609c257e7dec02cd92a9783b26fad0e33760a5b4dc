<p>Dream of making artificial body parts becoming a reality</p>
<p>17/01/2012</p>
<p>It sounds like a sci-fi movie – doctors growing body parts to cure our ills. But thanks to incredible breakthroughs, bionic repairs for humans are fast becoming a reality.</p>
<p>Experts yesterday revealed they are perfecting “off the shelf” blood vessels, which could revolutionise treatment of heart attacks and strokes.</p>
<p>If the Cambridge University blood vessel team is successful, patients could be spared major operations. The test tube vessels may also treat kidney dialysis patients and repair injuries.</p>
<p>And because the patient’s own skin cells are used, there is less chance of rejection.</p>
<p>Professor Jeremy Pearson, of the British Heart Foundation, said: “This is very advanced. Growing blood vessels means they could be used off the shelf and be put into patients who need bypasses in a leg or heart, which is currently done using their own veins.”</p>
<p>Here are other ways science is giving nature a helping hand...</p>
<p>1. EYES</p>
<p>Experts are working on a cure for blindness - and have taken huge strides towards their goal.</p>
<p>Miikka Terho, 46, from Finland, who suffered an inherited form of blindness called retinitis pigmentosa, was fitted with an experimental chip behind his retina in Germany.</p>
<p>It works by converting light that enters the eye into electrical impulses fed into the optic nerve, restoring some vision.</p>
<p>2. EARS</p>
<p>Bionic ears are transforming the lives of patients. They send sounds from a microphone through a metal coil to electrodes inside the inner ear.</p>
<p>A seven-year-old boy, Troy Probert, who was left deaf after seven meningitis bouts, was able to hear again thanks to computer-activated cochlear implants.</p>
<p>3. WINDPIPE</p>
<p>Patients whose windpipes are ravaged by cancer can have new ones grown in the lab. Scientists at University College London crafted a fake windpipe filled with cells taken from a patient’s own bone marrow.</p>
<p>Once fitted, the cells divided and grew to make an organ indistinguishable from a normal one.</p>
<p>4. BRAIN</p>
<p>Brain “pacemakers” are being developed to treat conditions such as Parkinson’s disease.</p>
<p>Patients with the implants, which send electronic impulses deep inside the brain, reported fewer tremors and stiffness. It involves inserting a wire with electrodes at its tip, which is connected to a small “neurostimulator” unit.</p>
<p>5. FACE</p>
<p>A liquid that can be injected into the face is being developed to help treat disfigured people. Surgeons could use it to rebuild areas damaged by disease or injury.</p>
<p>The liquid, created by Alexander Hillel and his colleagues at Johns Hopkins University, Maryland, US, can be massaged into shape and set using a special light beam.</p>
<p>6. ARM</p>
<p>Amputees could be given a new lease of life with bionic limbs. Livingston-based Touch Bionics’ prostethic arm allowed Patrick Kane, 13, who lost his arm through meningitis, to squash grapes between his fingers.</p>
<p>When he tenses a muscle, tiny pulses of electricity from nerves beneath the electrodes cause the hand to close - and the same process applies for opening his fist.</p>
