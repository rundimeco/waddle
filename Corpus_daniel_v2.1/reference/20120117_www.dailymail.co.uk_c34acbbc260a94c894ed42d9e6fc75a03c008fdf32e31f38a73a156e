<p>Is Blue Monday the most depressing day of the year... or was it all a marketing scam to make us book vacations?</p>
<p>The third Monday of January is allegedly the most depressing day of the year - when we forget our good intentions for a healthy diet and exercise and wallow on the couch in a cloud of self-pity while bemoaning the miserable weather.</p>
<p>However it has been suggested that the whole concept is based on junk science drummed up by a travel company as a clever ploy to have us booking holidays to sunnier climes.</p>
<p>According to psychologist Cliff Arnall, today is when most people are at their lowest ebb, a scientific formula he came up with based on the length of time until next Christmas, holiday debt and the likelihood of giving up New Year's resolutions.</p>
<p>Down in the dumps: The third Monday of January has been dubbed 'Blue Monday' thanks to miserable weather and the likelihood to give up New Year's resolutions</p>
<p>Mr Arnall, who is a tutor at Cardiff University in Wales, wrote about 'Blue Monday' six years ago - in a press release for Sky Travel, a now defunct British TV travel channel.</p>
<p>He based the theory on the 'hibernation' effect - a time of year when people feel tired, don't exercise, stay indoors and eat comfort food.</p>
<p>However psychiatrist Dean Burnet told the Guardian: 'True clinical depression (as opposed to a post-Christmas slump), is a far more complex condition that is affected by many factors, chronic and temporary, internal and external.'</p>
<p>However Mr Arnall was standing behind his theory, even telling a radio station this morning that today should be called 'Red Monday' as it is potentially the most depressing day ever.</p>
<p>Resolutions: Blue Monday is based on a 'scientific formula' that people feel low having given up good intentions to exercise more and eat less</p>
<p>In an interview with BBC Good Morning Scotland: 'It is the combination of factors that make life right now particularly uncertain. There is threat of job redundancy and the cost of food and fuel are going up.'</p>
<p>In another past press release by Mr Arnall, this time for ice-cream company Wall's, he claimed that the 'happiest' day of the year was June 23 - based on a formula of  outdoor activity, high energy levels and amount of sunlight.</p>
