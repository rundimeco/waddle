<p>EasyJet throws disabled businessman off flight as he cannot walk to emergency exit</p>
<p>A disabled businessman has been thrown off a budget flight – because he could not walk to the emergency exit.</p>
<p>EasyJet staff told Dr Martin Sabry, 39, who is paralysed from the chest down, that he could not travel on his own.</p>
<p>He said ground control told him he could board the plane, but the captain over-ruled the decision and he was told all single passengers must be able to reach the exit.</p>
<p>Dr Sabry says he often flies for work and had never had this issue. He said yesterday: “It was so demeaning and unbelievable the way they treated me and the purser was obnoxiously rude.”</p>
<p>Dr Sabry, from Cambridge, waited four hours to speak to bosses, who apologised, put him on the next flight from Gatwick to Toulouse and paid for his taxi transfer.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman said: “All passengers travelling alone must be able to make their way to an exit unaided – it seems there was a misunderstanding regarding this.”</p>
