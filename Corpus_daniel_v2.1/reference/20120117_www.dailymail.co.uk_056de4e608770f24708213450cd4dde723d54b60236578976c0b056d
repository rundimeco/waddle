<p>It's enough to send a shiver down the spine of any pneumonia victim.</p>
<p>When unemployed New York doorman Alexis Rodriguez was handed his medical bill after three weeks in hospital, he must have felt ill.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old knew his Bronx-Lebanon Hospital bill would  be big, but $44 million?</p>
<p>Shock: Alexis Rodriguez was treated at the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital - but received a staggering bill</p>
<p>'I almost had an asthma attack,' Mr Rodriguez told the New York Daily News.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he was not alone. Mr Rodriguez was just one of several hundred patients to receive absurdly inflated bills because of a 'system error'.</p>
<p>The amount he owed was $44,776,587 for outpatient services that in reality amounted to no more than $300.</p>
<p>More...</p>

<p>Mr Rodriguez panicked at first because he had spent three weeks in the hospital with pneumonia in the spring and knew he had to pay part of the $40,000 cost.</p>
<p>But he quickly realised the terrifying invoice couldn’t be right. He called the billing company and found out he wasn’t the only one with sticker shock.</p>
<p>The billing firm, PHY Services, said it was a simple mistake: The subcontractor that prints the bills put the invoice number into the 'amount due' field.</p>
<p>The company has apparently been deluged with complaints and said it would be sending out an apology.</p>
<p>A recording for callers says: 'If you are calling with respect to a billing statement for services provided at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, please disregard the statement. You will be receiving a new statement shortly. '</p>
<p>Mr Rodriguez said that even though no harm was done to his bottom line, the sloppiness surprised him.</p>
<p>'It was a big error,' he said. 'I think they should have somebody look over the bills before they send them out.'</p>
<p>Hospital spokesman Errol Schneer said he didn’t blame Mr Rodriguez for being upset.</p>
<p>'We certainly share any concerns he would have,' he said.</p>
