<p>Wales pays to replace French-made breast implants â€“ but England won't</p>
<p>The Welsh government says it will pay to replace French-made PIP breast implants for women who were treated privately.</p>
<p>Welsh health minister Lesley Griffiths said not replacing the implants could endanger women's health, given some have already ruptured.</p>
<p>The health secretary, Andrew Lansley, will rule out following suit in England when he updates MPs on the scandal today.</p>
<p>The Commons health select committee is to inquire into the cosmetic treatments industry.</p>
<p>"There's been a huge explosion in this country in cosmetic procedures generally over the last 10 years, particularly driven by celebrity culture and programmes like The Only Way Is Essex.</p>
<p>"Yet at the moment not everyone who carries out these invasive procedures is properly qualified, and procedures such as dermal fillers and Botox injections have the potential to make this a cowboy industry. We need to protect women and have a proper framework," said Dr Daniel Poulter, the Conservative MP for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, who is a committee member and hospital doctor.</p>
