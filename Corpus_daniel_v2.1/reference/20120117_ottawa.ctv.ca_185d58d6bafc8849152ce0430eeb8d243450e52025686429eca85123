<p>Blue Monday: 'Most depressing day' or junk science?</p>

<p>Gloomy readers, take heed. There may be a reason why you rolled out bed this morning with a proverbial black cloud looming overhead.</p>
<p>It's Blue Monday, an ill-reputed date that has been dubbed "the most depressing day of the year."</p>
<p>The theory stretches back to 2005 when psychologist Cliff Arnall was asked to figure out the most miserable day of the year.</p>
<p>Using an elaborate math formula, he came up with the third Monday in January – as if Mondays weren't demonized enough already.</p>
<p>Arnall reasoned that Blue Monday is the day when a slew of unpleasant variables such as drab weather, failing New Year's resolutions and Christmas bills collide, creating a veritable maelstrom of negativity.</p>
<p>"Motivational levels also tend to be quite low at this time of year," Arnall told CTV's Canada AM last Blue Monday.</p>
<p>"You've got something called the 'hibernation effect,' when people tend to be more lethargic, they eat more than they really need."</p>
<p>There are some questions, however, about whether Arnall's theory is actually valid.</p>
<p>Arnall was asked to whip up his formula for a public relations firm as part of a marketing campaign for travel company, Sky Travel. What better reason to go on vacation than to lessen the effects of the "most depressing day of the year?"</p>
<p>Psychiatry lecturer Dean Burnett is one of many critics who have dismissed Arnall's equation as ludicrous. In particular, he takes issue with the theory's liberal use of the word "depressing."</p>
<p>"True clinical depression (as opposed to a post-Christmas slump) is a far more complex condition that is affected by many factors, chronic and temporary, internal and external," he wrote in an editorial for the Guardian.</p>
<p>Even Arnall, the harbinger of doom himself, has conceded that his theory is not particularly helpful.</p>
<p>While he still stands behind his Blue Monday formula, Arnall told London's Telegraph newspaper two years ago that the date has become a "self-fulfilling prophecy."</p>
<p>Instead of dwelling on the date, he urged people to focus on happiness year round.</p>
<p>"I'm pleased about the impact it if it means people are talking about depression…but I'm also encouraging people to refute the whole notion of there being a most depressing day and to use the day as a springboard for the things that really matter in your life," he told the paper.</p>
<p>Still, many continue to latch onto the idea of Blue Monday.</p>
<p>This year, it didn't take long for the topic "Blue Monday" to trend on Twitter, landing only a few spots below #HappyMLKday -- a tag honouring Martin Luther King Jr., the famed civil rights activist who makes headlines on the third Monday of January for entirely different reasons.</p>
