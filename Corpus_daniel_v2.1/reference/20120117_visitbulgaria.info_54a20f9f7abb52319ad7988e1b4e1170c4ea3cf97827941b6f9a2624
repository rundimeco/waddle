<p>NHS Finding Hard to Deal with Neurology Issue</p>
<p>The NHS is already going through a very bad phase, and it seems like its troubles are not going to end anytime soon as the new stats released by Parkinson's UK have clearly depicted that there will be in excess of 28% increase in the cases confirmed positive for the highly dangerous Parkinson's disease by the year 2020.</p>
<p>At present, there are more than 127,000 individuals suffering from the grave-inspiring ailment, which generally tends to target muscular movement. But still, the figure is likely to reach a massive 162,000 by the year 2020. The statements have been based on an estimate made after analyzing the General Practice Research Database. Apart from the increase stated above, the number of people suffering from motor neurone disease is expected to spike up by more than 27% during the same period.</p>
<p>While expressing his views in this regard, the Chief Executive of Parkinson's UK, Steve Ford, said that the Government was in fact having had “it's head in the sand” and in addition to it, the demands for a "neurology tsar" for sorting out the entire scenario are gradually spiking up.</p>
<p>The Neurological Alliance covers the responsibility of as many as 70 groups, and it was of the opinion that an amalgamation of cheap services and increasing number of cases was in fact causing fair amount of troublesome issues.</p>
<p>It further took the bull by its horns, claiming that the NHS is not being able to fulfill its duties in this regard, while the government claimed that it is fully aware of whatever is going around in the region.</p>
<p>The government assured that it is completely in the know that there is a dire need for doing something that can ensure people get the best of services and the perilous issues of life-threatening diseases like the Parkinson's disease can be curbed in the nick of time.</p>
<p>The comments from the alliance narrowly tailed a report, released recently by the National Audit Office, which thoroughly condemned the standards of care being provided by the NHS.</p>
