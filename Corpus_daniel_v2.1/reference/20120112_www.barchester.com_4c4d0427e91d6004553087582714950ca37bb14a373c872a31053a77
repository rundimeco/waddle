<p>Researchers question the benefits of aspirin</p>
<p>Aspirin benefits not as high as previously thought.</p>
<p>Researchers have questioned the benefits of aspirin to stave off heart attack or stroke in people without a history of cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>Aspirin may not have the same level of positive effect previously thought, given the associated risk of internal bleeding, when trying to prevent heart attack or stroke, according to a study at St George's University of London.</p>
<p>The drug has been widely used to reduce the risk of clots forming in blood vessels, which lead to heart disease and stroke.</p>
<p>However, according to the study, clinicians have failed to assess the relative benefit of aspirin in relation to the possible side effects for people without a history of cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>Dr Sharlin Ahmed, research liaison officer at the Stroke Association, commented: "People who think that taking aspirin on a regular basis as a precaution without advice from their doctor should be aware of the potential harm they could be causing themselves."</p>
<p>However, those who have specifically been told to take aspirin following a cardiovascular episode should continue to do so, according to Dr Ahmed.</p>
<p>An alternative preventative treatment to aspirin has not yet been discovered, despite studies trying to develop such a drug to limit side effects.</p>
