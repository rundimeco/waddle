<p>Keogh's review will look at whether there needs to be better regulation of cosmetic products and surgery in Britain and Europe and whether patients "can be confident that the people who carry out procedures have the skills to do so", Lansley said.</p>
<p>The review will also look at record keeping, Lansley said, saying the implant affair had shown safety information the industry collected was of variable quality. "Without good data, we have no way of knowing when problems arise," he said.</p>
<p>About 300,000 PIP implants were sold worldwide before the firm went out of business after an official probe revealed it was using a cheaper unapproved industrial-grade silicone in some products.</p>
<p>A British review found no link between the implants and cancer, but had not been able to establish if the PIP implants were more likely to rupture than others, saying information from the industry to the regulator was patchy.</p>
