<p>Falklands turns away cruise ship</p>
<p>Princess Cruises says it is surprised and disappointed that the Falkland Islands government turned away its Star Princess ship.</p>
<p>The ship had planned to dock in Port Stanley on a cruise from Chile to Brazil, with stops in Argentina.</p>
<p>Many Argentines are among the 3,500 passengers and crew.</p>
<p>The cruise comes as Argentina and Britain engage in a diplomatic row over the islands Argentina calls the Malvinas.</p>
<p>Falklands government spokesman Darren Christie said they had to deny entry because some passengers had stomach flu and the islands are ill-equipped to handle a contagious virus.</p>
<p>But Princess Cruises said the decision was unwarranted and unscientific and runs against international health policy.</p>
<p>Hundreds died when Britain drove out occupying Argentine forces in 1982.</p>
