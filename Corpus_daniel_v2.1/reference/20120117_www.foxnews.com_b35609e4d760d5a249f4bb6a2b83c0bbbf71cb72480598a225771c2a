<p>A New Jersey woman went into labor on a commuter train Monday and gave birth to a baby boy before it pulled into the station, witnesses said.</p>
<p>The woman and her husband boarded the Manhattan-bound PATH train shortly after 9:30 a.m. Â at the Journal Square station in Jersey City, N.J.</p>
<p>Before the train made its second stop at the Newport station, the woman went into labor.</p>
<p>"She was not in labor long," said Port Authority spokesman Ron Marsico.</p>
<p>The train's conductor made an announcement that the woman had given birth, and said the train would be skipping stops to 33rd Street in Manhattan.</p>
<p>"God bless the little one," the conductor said.</p>
<p>Cops who responded at 33rd Street said the father calmly delivered the boy on the floor of the car surrounded by stunned passengers.</p>
<p>The baby was in his dad's arms when cops arrived.</p>
<p>One train rider sacrificed his coat to cover the woman up.</p>
<p>Officials said the 31-year-old new mom and her husband are from Harrison, N.J.</p>
<p>The woman and baby boy were rushed to St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital in New York, where they were doing well, officials said.</p>
