<p>'Exercise hormone' may help fight fat</p>
<p>CINCINNATI - We all know exercise contributes to better health and well-being.  It makes us feel better!</p>
<p>And now researchers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School have discovered an 'exercise hormone,"called irisin.</p>
<p>They say this hormone is produced in response to exercise, and that it may be turning people's white fat brown, a process which they say will lessen susceptibility to obesity, diabetes, and other health problems.</p>
<p>Brown vs. white?  Scientists say brown fat is more useful  It actually burns calories.  White fat just sits there.</p>
<p>Researchers studied mouse and human muscle cells. They suspected that muscle cells communicate biochemically with body fat, leading to health benefits.</p>
<p>Much study remains to be done, but researchers are excited about what irisin could do for people who might not be able to exercise.</p>
