<p>HE has never had sex, yet fathers 14 children.</p>
<p>Trent Arsenault hit the headlines last December when his free sperm bank came under investigation from the US Food and Drug Administration, which threatened him with a $100,000 fine and up to a year in jail.</p>
<p>Now, the Fremont, California local who bills himself as having an ideal gene pool to father children, has revealed that he is a 36-year-old virgin.</p>
<p>The revelation on CNN host Anderson Cooper's daytime show, Anderson, means that the self-confessed tech-geek, an expert in Silicon Valley, finds himself in the highly unusual position of never having had sex, but fathering 14 healthy offspring.</p>
<p>Speaking on the chat show, Mr Arsenault said: "I coined this term 'donor sexual' and I'll explain it means 100 per cent of my sexual energy is for producing sperm for childless couples to have babies. So I don't have other activity outside of that."</p>
<p>An incredulous Mr Cooper asked: "So you do not have sex?"</p>
<p>"I will probably be the 40-year-old virgin," the donor explained. "Except I'll have 15 plus kids" - a statement that drew applause from the audience, to the confusion of the host.</p>
<p>The show saw the virgin dad meet one of his progeny for the first time as Analise, who turns two this week, walked onto the stage.</p>
<p>A visibly emotional Mr Arsenault said the meeting was a "a thrill". The toddler is mothered by a lesbian couple who seemed overjoyed following the donor's decision to help them conceive.</p>
